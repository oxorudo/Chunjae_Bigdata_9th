      "이번 수업 시간에는 각의 종류에 대해 알아보겠습니다. 각의 종류에는 예각, 직각, 둔각이 있습니다. 왜 이런 이름이 붙어졌는지에 대해서 알아봅시다. 우선 예각이란 무엇일까요? 이해하기 편하시도록 그림으로 그려드리겠습니다. 예각은 이 그림이랑 비슷하게 생겼습니다. 한 점에서 뻗어나오는 두선분을 그렸는데 이 각도 예각이 될 수 있고 두선분이 교체하며 만들어진 각도 예각이 될 수 있습니다. 노란색 그림은 두 각 모두 예각입니다. 직각에 대해 알아보면 반직선 또는 선분이 두 개 있을 때 한 선분은 수평으로 가고 다른 선분은 수직으로 갈 때 생기는 각입니다. 그림으로 그려보면 이 선은 왼쪽에서 오른쪽으로 가고 다른 선은 아래에서부터 위로 갈 것입니다. 여기 있는 이 각은 직각입니다. 각을 이렇게 표시할 수도 있지만 보통 직각은 작은 네모로 표시합니다. 이 네모 표시는 각이 직각이라는 것을 나타냅니다. 이 선이 왼쪽에서 오른쪽으로 가고 이 선이 아래에서 위로 갈 때 이 각이 직각이라고 불리는 이유는 이 선이 수평선에 대해 완전히 수직을 이루기 때문이겠습니다. 만약 이 선과 이런 선이 있다면 여기 있는 이 직각은 이 선이 이 선을 기준으로 했을 때 완벽히 수직을 이룬다는 것을 의미합니다. 이것이 바로 직각의 의미입니다. 자 이제 직각의 정의에 대해서 알아봤으니 이제 예각을 다른 정의로 표현해 보겠습니다. 예각이란 건 직각보다 작은 각으로 의미합니다. 각의 측정 방법인 라디안과 도에 대해 배우면 직각이 90도라는 것을 알게 될 것입니다. 이 각은 90도보다 작음으로 예각입니다. 이를 정리하자면 예각은 직각보다 열린 구간이 더 작고 좁으며 이 선을 다른 선까지 회전시킬 때 직각일 때보다 더 적게 돌려도 됩니다. 직각일 때는 이 선을 여기까지 움직여야 하지만 예각일 때는 조금만 움직여도 됩니다. 그러므로 예각은 직각보다 작습니다. 이제 둔각에 대해서 알아봅시다. 우선 알아야 할 게 둔각은 직각보다 큽니다. 둔각을 몇 개 그려보겠습니다. 둔각은 이렇게 생겼습니다. 직각보다 많이 벌어져 있다는 것을 알 수 있습니다. 이게 만약 직각이었다면 이 선은 아래에 있는 기준선에 대해 수직을 이룰 것입니다. 하지만 여기 주황선을 보면 직각일 때보다 더 넓게 벌려져 있습니다. 그러므로 이 각은 둔각입니다. 이런 각의 이름들은 실생활에서 따온 것들입니다. 예각은 매우 날카롭다는 뜻입니다. 예리하다 할 때의 예입니다. 둔각은 둔하다 할 때의 둔입니다. 예각의 꼭집점 부분을 보면 납득하실 겁니다. 매우 예리하고 작게 열려있는 것입니다. 둔각은 이와 반대로 덜 예리하고 더 크게 열려 있습니다. 너무 둔해서 작은 변화도 알아차리지 못할 겁니다. 비유가 적절한지 모르겠네요. 아무튼 둔각을 정의하자면 더 크게 열려있고 직각보다 큽니다. 둔각은 90도보다 크고 이 선을 다른 선까지 회전시키려면 직각보다 더 많이 회전시켜야 하며 예각보다 훨씬 더 많이 회전시켜야 합니다. 그림으로 나타내 드리겠습니다. 어떤 것이 둔각이고 어떤 게 예각일까요? 그림을 보면 여기 좁은 구간이 예각이고 넓은 곳이 둔각입니다. 위에 있는 그림에도 둔각을 표시한다면 여기와 여기가 둔각입니다. 직각을 기준으로 직각보다 각이 작으면 예각이고 각이 크다면 둔각입니다.\n",

      "점A에서 시작해 점B를 지나는 반직선AB가 있다고 가정해봅시다. 너무 이상하네요. 조금 더 반듯하게 그려보겠습니다. 반직선AB는 A가 시작점이거나 꼭집점입니다. 반직선AC도 있다고 가정해봅시다. 이곳에 실을 정하고 그리겠습니다. 점A에서 시작해 점C를 지나는 반직선을 그린다면 이것이 반직선AC가 됩니다. 흥미로운 사실은 두 개의 반직선이 같은 꼭집점A를 갖는다는 사실입니다. 같은 꼭집점에서 시작하는 두 개의 반직선이 있을 때 각이 만들어집니다. 각이 무엇인지 기억하십니까? 각은 영어로 angle이라고 하는데 라틴아로 구석을 뜻합니다. 참고로 꽤 많은 영어 단어가 라틴어에서 유래했습니다. 각A를 한번 보시죠. 구석처럼 생겼죠? 그래서 이러한 이름이 붙은 것입니다. 기아학이란 도형을 다루는 학문에서 각의 정의는 두 개의 반직선이 한 꼭집점을 공유할 때 공유하는 꼭집점을 각이 꼭집점이라고 합니다. 점A는 꼭집점입니다. 위에 영어로 적어드리겠습니다. 꼭집점이라는 뜻입니다. 점A는 반직선AB와AC의 꼭집점인 동시에 각이 꼭집점이라고도 할 수 있습니다. 이제 각을 어떻게 나타내는지 알려드리겠습니다. 잘 보고 따라해보십시오. 각A라고 나타내는 것은 사실 정확하지 않은 표현입니다. 왜냐하면 어떤 점이 각을 구성하는지에 따라 각의 이름이 달라지기 때문입니다. 그렇다면 각의 이름을 정의해봅시다. 이것이 바로 각을 나타내는 기호입니다. 옆에 그림 각과 비슷하게 생겼습니다. 부등호 기호와도 비슷하게 생겼습니다. 하지만 부등호 기호와 가장 큰 차이점은 각을 나타내는 이 기호는 바닥이 평평하지만 부등호를 나타내는 기호는 바닥이 평평하지 않습니다. 이 기호를 사용해 각BAC나 각CAB를 나타냅니다. 두 경우 모두 각을 구체적으로 나타냅니다. 여기서 중요한 것은 각의 꼭집점A가 각의 이름 한가운데에 와야 한다는 것입니다. 다시 한번 보면 항상 A는 가운데에 있습니다. 왜, 어째서 각A라고 쓰면 안되고 굳이 이렇게 나타내야 하는 것일까요? 그 이유를 파헤쳐봅시다. 우선 다른 각을 그려보겠습니다. 기하학, 즉 도형을 다루는 학문에서 각은 한 꼭집점을 공유하는 두밤직선으로 이루어진 것입니다. 문제를 풀 때는 선분과 직선으로 이루어져 있는 각을 볼 수 있을 겁니다. 선분을 한 방향으로 계속 연장해 나간다면 반직선이 되기 때문에 각의 정의에서 크게 벗어나지 않습니다. 예를 들어 이렇게 하나의 선분이 있다고 가정해봅시다. 이것을 선분D라고 하고 다른 선분FG가 있다고 가정해봅시다. 두 개의 선분이 만나는 지점을 H라고 하겠습니다. 각의 이름들을 찾아봅시다. 여기 이 각은 각H라고 부를 수 있을까요? 각H는 점H를 꼭집점으로 갖는 각입니다. 여기나 여기도 각H가 될 수 있는 것입니다. 사실상 여기 모든 각이 H에서 만나기 때문에 모두 각H가 될 수 있습니다. 이렇게 때문에 각을 정확하게 표현해서 정확한 각을 지정해야 합니다. 따라서 각을 표현할 때 문자 3개로 나타내는 것입니다. 그러므로 정확하게 이 각을 나타내려면 각EHG나 각DHE라고 나타내야 합니다. 다른 것도 해봅시다. 여기 이 넓은 각은 어떻게 나타낼 수 있을까요? 한번 알아봅시다. 이것은 점D와 점G를 지나서 쭉 뻗어가는 반직선 HD와 HG로 이루어져 있으므로 각DHG나 각DHD라고 나타낼 수 있습니다. 다른 각들도 살펴봅시다. 왼쪽의 각은 각FHE라고 나타내거나 각EHF라고 하며 위쪽의 각은 각FHD 또는 각EHF라고 표현합니다. 이렇게 나타낸다면 어떤 각을 가르키는지 정확하게 알 수 있습니다. 지금까지 각이 이름을 나타내는 방법에 대해 알아보았습니다. 하지만 모든 각의 크기가 다 같은 것은 아닙니다. 어떤 각도는 다른 각도보다 클 수도 있고 또 어떤 각도는 다른 각도보다 작을 수도 있습니다. 예를 들어 여기에 두 개의 각을 그려보겠습니다. 여기 각을 하나 그리고 각점들을 A, B, C라고 하겠습니다. 여기 길이를 늘려서 반직선으로 만들 수도 있고 그냥 선분으로 두어도 됩니다. 여러분께 맡기겠습니다. 이 각의 이름은 각BAC입니다 아니면 각CAB라고 해도 상관없습니다. 그리고 여기서 각을 하나 더 그려보겠습니다. 각점을 X, Y, Z라고 하겠습니다. 방금 전이랑 똑같이 반직선으로 만들 수 있고 그냥 선분으로 둘 수 있습니다. 이 각의 이름은 각XYZ입니다. 또는 각ZYX라고 표현할 수도 있겠죠. 두 각을 비교해보면 각XYZ가 더 많이 열려있다는 것을 한눈에 봐도 알 수 있습니다. 바꿔서 설명하면 각BAC는 각XYZ보다 더 닫혀있다고 표현할 수 있습니다. 각도를 지을 때에는 각이 얼마나 열려있는지 또 얼마나 닫혀있는지를 토대로 측정해야 합니다. 그러므로 각을 측정하는 방법을 알려주지 않아도 각XYZ의 크기는 각BAC보다 더 크다고 할 수 있습니다. 어떤 각이든 얼마나 열려있는지를 비교한다면 쉽게 어떤 각이 더 큰지를 알 수 있을 것입니다.\n",

      "For each of these diagrams, I want to think about whether this blue line represents an axis of symmetry. And the way we can tell is if, on both sides of the blue line, we essentially have mirror images. So let's imagine, let's take this top part of this polygon, the part that is above this blue line here. And let's reflect it across the blue line. You could almost imagine that it's a reflection over some type of a lake or something, and see if we get exactly what we have below. Then this would be an axis of symmetry. So this point right over here, this distance to the blue line, let's go the same amount on the other side, would get you right there. And so you immediately see, we start ending up with a point that is off what's actually here in black, the actual bottom part of the polygon. So this is a pretty good clue that this is not an axis of symmetry. But let's just continue it, just to go through the exercise. So this point, if you reflected it across this blue line, would get you here. This point, we'll do it in a different color. This point, if you were to reflect it across this blue line, it would get you, make sure I can do that relatively straight. I can do a straighter job than that. So if you go about that distance about it, and I want to go straight down into the blue line, and say I'm going to go the same distance on the other side, it gets me to right around there. And then this point over here, if I were to drop it straight down, then if I were to go the same distance on the other side, it gets me right around there. And then finally, this point gets me right around there. So its mirror image of this top part would look something like this. My best attempt to draw it would look something like this, which is very different than the part of the polygon that's actually on the other side of this blue line. So in this case, the blue line is not an axis of symmetry. So this is no, no, this blue line is not an axis of symmetry. Now let's look at it over here. And our eyes pick this out very naturally. Here you can see that it looks like this blue line really divides this polygon in half. It really does look like mirror images. It really does look like, if you imagine that this is some type of a lake, a still lake, so I shouldn't actually draw waves, but this is some type of a lake, that this is the reflection. And we can even go point by point here. So this point right over here is the same distance from if we dropped a perpendicular to this point as this one right over here. This one over here, same distance as this point right over here. And we could do that for all of the points. So in this case, the blue line does represent an axis of symmetry.\n",

      "What I want to do in this video is give an introduction to the language or some of the characters that we use when we talk about geometry. And I guess the best place to start is to even think about what geometry means. As you might recognize, the first part of geometry right over here, you have the root word geo, the same word that you see in things like geography and geology. And this comes, this refers to the Earth. This refers, my E looks like a C right over there. This refers to the Earth. And then you see this metri part. And you see metri in things like trigonometry as well. And metri, or the metric system, and this comes from measurement. This comes from measurement or measure, measurement. So when someone's talking about geometry, the word itself comes from Earth measurement. And that's kind of not so bad of a name because it is such a general subject. Geometry really is the study and trying to understand how shapes and space and things that we see relate to each other. So when you start learning about geometry, you learn about lines and triangles and circles. And you learn about angles. And we'll define all of these things more and more precisely as we go further and further on. But also encapsulate things like patterns and three-dimensional shapes. So it's almost everything that we see, all of the visually mathematical things that we understand can in some way be categorized in geometry. Now, with that out of the way, let's just start from the basics, a basic starting point from geometry. And then we can just grow from there. So if we just start at a dot, that dot right over there, it's just a point. It's just that little point on that screen right over there. We'd literally call that a point. And I'll call that a definition. And the fun thing about mathematics is that you can make definitions. We could have called this an armadillo. But we decide to call this a point, which I think makes sense because it's what we would call it in just everyday language as well. That is a point. Now, what's interesting about a point is that it is just a position, that you can't move on a point. If you moved, if you were at this point, and if you moved in any direction at all, you would no longer be at that point. So you cannot move on a point. Now, there are differences between points. For example, that's one point there. Maybe I have another point over here. And then I have another point over here. And then another point over there. And you want to be able to refer to the different points. And not everyone has the luxury of a nice colored pen like I do. Otherwise, they could refer to the green point, or the blue point, or the pink point. And so in geometry, to refer to points, we tend to give them labels. And the labels tend to have letters. So for example, this could be point A. This could be point B. This would be point C. And this right over here could be point D. So if someone says, hey, circle point C, you know which one to circle. You know that you would have to circle that point right over there. Well, that so far, it's kind of interesting. You have these things called points. You really can't move around on a point. All they do is specify a position. What if we want to move around a little bit more? What if we want to get from one point to another? So what if we started at one point, and we wanted all of the points, including that point, that connect that point and another point? So all of these points right over here. So what would we call this thing? All of the points that connect A and B along a straight, and I'll use everyday language here, along kind of a straight line like this. Well, we'll call this a line segment. In everyday language, you might call it a line, but we'll call it a line segment. Because we'll see when we talk in mathematical terms, a line means something slightly different. So this is a line segment. And if we were to connect D and C, this would also be another line segment. And once again, because we always don't have the luxury of colors, this one is clearly the orange line segment. This is clearly the yellow line segment. We want to have labels for these line segments. And the best way to label the line segments are with its end points. And that's another word here. So a point is just literally A or B. But A and B are also the end points of these line segments, because it starts and ends at A and B. So let me write this. A and B are end points. Another definition right over here. Once again, we could have called them aardvarks or end armadillos. But we as mathematicians decide to call them end points, because that seems to be a good name for it. And once again, we need a way to label these line segments that have the end points. And what's a better way to label a line segment than with its actual end points? So we would refer to this line segment over here. We would put its end points there. And to show that it's a line segment, we would draw a line over it, just like that. This line segment down here, we would write it like this. And we could have just as easily written it like this. CD with a line over it would have referred to that same line segment. BA with a line over it would refer to that same line segment. Now you might be saying, well, I'm not satisfied just traveling in between A and B. And this is actually another interesting idea. When you were just on A, when you were just on a point, and you couldn't travel at all, you couldn't travel in any direction while staying on that point, that means you have zero options to travel in. You can't go up or down, left or right, in or out of the page, and still be on that point. And so that's why we say a point has zero dimensions. Zero dimensions. Now all of a sudden, we have this thing, this line segment here. And this line segment, we can at least go to the left and the right along this line segment. We can go towards A or towards B. So we can go back or forward in one dimension. So the line segment is a one dimensional idea, almost, or one dimensional object, although these are more kind of abstract ideas. There is no such thing as a perfect line segment. Because a line segment, you can't move up or down on this line segment while being on it. While in reality, anything that we think is a line segment, even a stick of some type, a very straight stick, or a string that is taut, that still will have some width. But the geometrical pure line segment has no width. It only has a length here. So you can only move along the line. And that's why we say it's one dimensional. A point, you can't move at all. A line segment, you can only move in that back and forth along that same direction. Now, I just hinted that it can actually have a length. How do you refer to that? Well, you refer to that by not writing that line on it. So if I write AB with a line on top of it like that, that means I'm referring to the actual line segment. If I say that, let me do this in a new color, if I say that AB is equal to 5 units, it might be centimeters or meters or whatever, just the abstract unit's 5, that means that the distance between A and B is 5, that the length of line segment AB is actually 5. Now, let's keep on extending it. Let's say we want to just keep going in one direction. So let's say that I started A. Let me do this in a new color. Let's say I started A, and I want to go to D, but I want the option of keep on going. So I can't go further in A's direction than A, but I can go further in D's direction. So this idea that I just showed, essentially it's like a line segment, but I can keep on going past this end point, we call this a ray. And the starting point for a ray is called the vertex. Not a term that you'll see too often. You'll see vertex later on in other contexts, but it's good to know. This is the vertex of the ray. It's not the vertex of this line segment, so maybe I shouldn't label it just like that. And what's interesting about a ray, it's once again a one-dimensional figure, but you could keep on going in one of the direct. You can keep on going to or past one of the end points. And the way that we would specify a ray is we would say, we would call it AD, and we would put this little arrow over on top of it to show that it is a ray. And in this case, it matters the order that we put the letters in. If I put DA as a ray, this would mean a different ray. That would mean that we're starting at D, and then we're going past A. So this is not ray DA, this is ray AD. Now the last idea that I'm sure you're thinking about is, well, what if I could keep on going in both directions? So let's say I can keep going in, let me, my diagram is getting messy. So let me introduce some more points. So let's say I have point E, and then I have point F right over here. And let's say that I have this object that goes through both E and F, but just keeps on going in both directions. This is, when we talk in geometry terms, this is what we call a line. Now notice, a line never ends. You can keep going in either direction. A line segment does end. It has end points. A line does not. And actually, a line segment can sometimes be called just a segment. And so you would specify line EF, you would specify line EF with these arrows just like that. Now the thing that you're gonna see most typically when we're studying geometry are these right over here, because we're gonna be concerned with sides of shapes, distances between points. And when you're talking about any of those things, things that have finite length, things that have an actual length, things that don't go off forever in one or two directions, then you're talking about a segment or a line segment. Now, if we go back to a line segment, just to kind of keep talking about new words that you might confront in geometry, if we go back talking about a line, that's, I was drawing a ray. So let's say I have point X and point Y. And so this is line segment XY. So I can specify it, denote it just like that. If I have another point, let's say I have another point right over here, let's call that point Z. And I'll introduce another word. X, Y, and Z are on the same, they all lie on the same line, if you would imagine that a line could keep going on and on forever and ever. So we can say that X, Y, and Z are collinear. So those three points are collinear. They all sit on the same line. And they also all sit on line segment XY. Now let's say we know, we're told that XZ is equal to ZY and they're all collinear. So that means this is telling us that the distance between X and Z is the same as the distance between Z and Y. So sometimes we can mark it like that. This distance is the same as that distance over there. So that tells us that Z is exactly halfway between X and Y. So in this situation, we would call Z the midpoint. The midpoint of line segment XY because it's exactly halfway between. Now to finish up, we've talked about things that have zero dimensions, points. We've talked about things that have one dimension, a line, a line segment, or a ray. You might say, well, what has two dimensions? Well, in order to have two dimensions, that means I can go backwards and forwards in two different directions. So this page right here or this video or the screen that you're looking at is a two-dimensional object. I can go right, left, that is one dimension, or I can go up, down. And so this surface of the monitor you're looking at is actually two dimensions. Two dimensions. You can go backwards or forwards in two directions. And things that are two dimensions, we call them planar, or we call them planes. So if you took a piece of paper that extended forever, just extended in every direction forever, that in the geometrical sense was a plane. The piece of paper itself, the thing that's finite, and you'll never see this talked about in a typical geometry class, but I guess if we were to draw the analogy, you could call a piece of paper maybe a plane segment because it's a segment of an entire plane. If you had a third dimension, then you're talking about kind of our three-dimensional space. In three-dimensional space, not only could you move left or right along the screen or up and down, you could also move in and out of the screen. You could also have this dimension that I'll try to draw. You could go into the screen or you could go out of the screen like that. And as we go into higher and higher mathematics, although it becomes very hard to visualize, you'll see that we can even start to study things that have more than three dimensions.\n",

      "Which side is perpendicular to side BC? So BC is this line segment right over here. And for another segment to be perpendicular to it, perpendicular just means that the two segments need to intersect at a right angle or at a 90 degree angle. And we see that BC intersects AB at a 90 degree angle. The symbol right over here represents a 90 degree or a right angle. So we just have to find side AB or BA. And that's right over here. Side AB is perpendicular to side BC. Let's do a few more of these. Put the triangles into the correct categories. So this right over here, let's think about our categories. Right triangles, so that means it has a 90 degree angle in it. Obtuse triangles, that means it has an angle larger than 90 degrees in it. Acute triangles, that means all three angles are less than 90 degrees. So this one has a 90 degree angle, has a right angle right over here. So this is a right triangle. This one right over here, all of these angles are less than 90 degrees, just eyeballing it. So this is going to be an acute triangle. I'll put it under acute triangles right over there. Then this one over here, this angle up here, this is, and we can assume that these actually are drawn to scale, this is more open than a 90 degree angle. This is an obtuse angle right over here. It's going to be more than 90 degrees. So this is an obtuse triangle. Now this one over here, all of them seem acute. None of them even seem to be a right angle. So I would put this again into acute triangles. This one here clearly has a right angle. It's labeled as such. So we'll throw it right over here. And then this one, this angle right over here is clearly even larger, has a larger measure than a right angle. So this angle right over here is more than 90 degrees. It's going to be an obtuse angle. So we will throw it into obtuse triangles. So we got two in each of these. And let's check our answer. We got it right.\n",

      "Categorize the following triangles according to whether or not they are obtuse triangles. So an obtuse triangle is a triangle that has an obtuse angle in it, or an angle that is larger than 90 degrees. So it's pretty clear that this one does not have any obtuse angles. This is a 90 degree angle, and then these are going to have to be less than 90 degrees. So this is not obtuse. This one right over here, just by looking at it, you see that all of them are less than 90 degrees. So I'll put this not obtuse. Now, these two are interesting. Angle JKL looks like it is larger than 90 degrees. And we can assume that these are drawn to scale, so we can base it on our kind of visual judgment. So I would say that this is obtuse. And angle BAC also looks like it is larger than 90 degrees. So that's an obtuse angle. So I would throw that in the obtuse bucket as well. So we had two not obtuse, two obtuse. Check our answer. Let's do a couple more of these. Which of the following are correct descriptions of triangle PIG, or I guess triangle pig? Select all that apply. PIG is equilateral. Well, that's not true. To be equilateral, all the sides have to be the same length. And we see here two sides are 7, but one side has length 4. So that's not true. Angle PIG has two equal angles. Well, we see that right over here, these two angles that are 74 degrees. So that's true. Triangle pig, I guess, has an obtuse angle. Well, an obtuse angle is one that's larger than 90 degrees. None of these are larger than 90. That's not true. Triangle PIG has three acute angles. Well, that is true. All of these angles are less than 90 degrees. Triangle PIG has a right angle. No, none of these angles are exactly 90 degrees. So it does not have a right angle. So let's check our answer. Let's do one more of this. This is actually kind of fun. Categorize the following triangles according to whether or not they are equilateral. So to be equilateral, all of the sides have to have the same length. So this is equilateral. This one, the sides are definitely not the same length. In fact, not even two of the sides are the same length. That's really a scalene triangle. Here, we have two sides that are the same length, but the third is different. This would be an isosceles triangle, but it's not equilateral. And here, they're all the same length. So we have an equilateral triangle. We got it right.\n",

      "Which shape matches all three clues? So here we have three clues and we want to see which shape down below matches all three of these statements. So let's start with the first clue. The first clue says the shape is a quadrilateral, quad, meaning four-sided. So looking down here at our shapes, let's see which ones match that first clue. Shape one has one, two, three, four sides, so it is a quadrilateral. Shape two has one, two, three, four sides, so also a quadrilateral. Shape three has one, two, three, four, five, six sides, so it is not a quadrilateral. It's a six-sided shape or a hexagon. So we can rule that one out. It doesn't match clue one, so there's no way it can match all three clues. And finally, shape four has one, two, three, four sides again, so it is also a quadrilateral. So after clue one, we still have three possible answers. This first shape, the second shape, and the fourth shape all match clue one. They are all quadrilaterals. Okay. Looking at clue two, it says our shape has no right angles. Right angles are also 90-degree angles. Right angles are 90-degree angles, and they look something like this. And we often see them marked with a square in the middle because they are sort of like square angles. We can create a square from the opening that they form, that these angles form. So this is a right angle. Looking now down at our shapes, we can see right away on shape one has two right angles. There's a square corner and another square corner. So this has right angles, but the shape we're looking for has no right angles, so we can rule this shape out. Shape two does not have any right angles. These are not squared-off corners. And same with shape four, no right angles. So both of those still match both clues one and two. So we have two shapes left. They're both quadrilaterals, and they have no right angles. And finally, our last clue, the shape has four sides. We knew that because it was a quadrilateral. And those sides are of equal length. That means each of the sides is the same length. Looking at this first one that we have left, shape two, it looks like these sides on the ends are shorter than the sides going up and down. So it looks like they are not equal length, so we can rule this one out. But let's be sure this last one works. Here, the sides all look like they're the same length, but the way we can know for sure that they are is these tick marks. Anytime you have these marks, it's saying that any side that has the same amount of marks is the same length. All four of these sides have exactly one tick mark, so they are all equal in length. So shape four matches all three clues. It is a quadrilateral. There are no right angles, and it has four sides of equal length. So shape four is our answer.\n",

      "Percent literally means per hundred. That's where the word comes from. Cent, from cents, or century, or any of those words mean 100. So if someone tells you seven per cent, and I'm separating the words so it makes a little more sense, they're really saying seven per hundred. This is the same thing as seven per hundred, which is the same thing as a fraction as seven per seven per hundred. With that out of the way, let's see if we can write, if we can write 0.601 as a percentage. Well, we essentially wanna write it as something over 100. So you could view it as, I'll just rewrite this part right over here. You could write it as 0.601 over one. This is obviously the same quantity. You divide anything by one, you're still going to get that same anything. And I'm gonna multiply it by, I'm gonna multiply it by 100 over 100. Obviously this won't change the value. This is just one here. But what this does is it'll give us a fraction and turn with the denominator being 100. So the denominator, if I multiply, if I multiply these two characters right over here in the denominator, the denominator of our product is going to be 100. If I multiply 0.601 times 100, what am I going to get? Well, every time I multiply it by a multiple of 10, or every time I multiply it by 10, I'm gonna shift the decimal over to the right once. So if I multiply it by 10, I'd get 6.01. And if I multiply it by 10 again, or if I multiply it by 100, I'm going to get 60.1. So 0.601 times 100 is 60.1. Let me rewrite that again. If I were to write, if I were to write 0.601, and I wanna multiply it by 100, shift the decimal once, I multiply it by 10. If I multiply it by 10 again, or essentially multiply it by 100, I get 60.1. So this is times 10, this is times 10 again. I've essentially multiplied it by 100. But now we have it in the form we like. We have 60.1 over 100. Or you could rewrite this, this is the same thing, as 60.1 per 100, per 100, which is the same thing as 60.1 per cent. And we'd obviously wanna write it then as 60.1 per cent as one word, or 60.1, and we'll just use the symbol, 60.1 per cent. We are done.\n",

      "Write 18% as a decimal and as a fraction in simplest form. So let's do it as a decimal first. So 18% is the same thing as 18 per 100, or 18 per cent. I'm actually separating out the percent word. It's probably one word, but I'm writing it as literally per cent. Cent means the same thing as 100. So this literally means 18 per 100. Actually, I said I would do the decimal first, but we can start putting it into a fraction first. 18 per 100 as a fraction literally means 18 per 100. So we're doing the fraction first. This literally means 18 per 100, or 18 hundredths. Now, if we want to do it, from here we could go straight to a decimal, or we could do this fraction in simplest form. Let's do the decimal first, just because that's actually where I said I would do first. So let's do that first. So how do we write? So this is the same thing as 18 hundredths. And we know how to write that in decimal form. It's 0.18. You could view this as 1 tenth and 8 hundredths, which is the same thing, or 10 hundredths and 8 hundredths, which is 18 hundredths. So this is written in decimal form. And if we write it as a simplified fraction, we need to see if there is a common factor for 18 and 100. And they're both even numbers, so we know they're both divisible by 2. So let's divide both the numerator and the denominator by 2. So we have 18 divided by 2 over 100 divided by 2. And we're going to get 18 divided by 2 is 9. 100 divided by 2 is 50. And I don't think these guys share any common factors. 50 is not divisible by 3. 9 is only divisible by 3 and 1 and 9. So this is the fraction in simplest form. So we have 18% is the same thing as 0.18, which is the same thing in simplest form as 9 fiftieths. Now, I went through a lot of, I guess, pain here to show you that, look, this really just comes from the word, from percent, from per hundred. But if you ever were to see this in a problem, the fast way to do this is to immediately say, OK, if I have 18%, you should immediately say, anything in front of the percent, that's that anything, whatever this anything is, this should be equal to that anything. In this case, it's 18 over 100. And another way to think about it, you could view this as 18.0%. So this is 18.0%. When you want to convert this, I just added a trailing 0 there, just so that you see the decimal, really. If you want to express this as a decimal without the percent, you just move this over to, you move the decimal to the left 2 spaces. So if we move the decimal to the left 2 spaces, 1, 2, this becomes 0.18. Or you could immediately say that, look, 18% as a fraction is 18 over 100. When you put it in simplified form, it's 9 over 50. But you should also see that 18 over 100, and we have seen this, is the exact same thing as 18 hundredths, or 0.18. Hopefully this made some connections for you and didn't confuse you.\n",

      "Let's write 113.9% as a decimal. So percent, this symbol right over here, literally means per hundred. So this is the same thing as 113.9 per hundred, which is the same thing as 113.9 divided by 100. So essentially if we want to write this as a decimal, we just take 113.9 and we divide it by 100. And to do that, 113.9 divided by 100. If you divide by 10, you move the decimal once to the left. If you divide by 100, you're moving the decimal twice to the left. If we were doing it by 1,000, we would go to the left once more, 10,000. Each time you divide by 10, you'd go one step to the left, which hopefully makes sense. If we were to multiply by 10, we would be moving the decimal over to the right. And there are other videos that go into far more depth and the intuition behind that. But anyway, we're dividing 113.9 by 100, so move the decimal two spaces to the left, so the decimal will end up right over here. So this will be equal to 1.139. And we are done.\n",

It's a positive 8, so we move 8 in the x-direction. So we move 8 in the x-direction. And then the second number in our ordered pair is 10. That is our y-coordinate. That tells us how far we move in the y-direction. Since it's positive, we move up 10. So we move up 10 all the way over here. And you could have thought about it either way. You could have said, hey, look, this is our y-coordinate. This is 10. So I could move up 10. And then my x-coordinate is positive 8, so I'll move 8 along the positive x-axis, or I'll move 8 to the right. You see right over here, I have moved 8 to the right. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. And I have moved 10 up. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. You might be tempted to move 8 up and then 10 to the right, which would put you there. But then you would have had the two numbers mixed up. You would have had the x and the y-coordinates mixed up. The 8 tells you how far to move in the horizontal direction. The 10 tells you how far to move in the vertical direction. Let's do a couple more of these. Plot 6 comma 10. Once again, the first number in the ordered pair is the x-coordinate, how far we move in the x-direction. So we move 6 to the right. And then the second number, the 10, tells us our vertical coordinate, our y-coordinate. So it's positive 10, so we move 10 up. Let's do one more. 5 comma 7. So my horizontal coordinate is 5, so I move 5 to the right. And then my vertical one is 7, or my y-coordinate is 7, so I move 7 up. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. And as long as you remember which one is horizontal and which one is vertical, or which one is the x-coordinate and which one is the y, you should be fine. You could say, hey, look, this is my y-coordinate 7. So I'm going to move 7 up. And my x-coordinate is 5, so I'm going to move 5 to the right. And it will get you to that exact same point.

      "Any pair of points can be connected by a line segment. That's right. Connect two pairs of black points in a way that creates two parallel line segments. So let's see if we can do that. So I could create one segment that connects these, this point to this point, and then another one that connects this point to this point, and they look pretty parallel. In fact, I think this is the right answer. If we did it another way, if we had connected that point to that point, if we connected that point to that point and this point to this point, then it wouldn't look so parallel. These clearly, if they were to keep going, they would intersect at some point. So let me set it back up the way I did it the first time. Let me make these two points parallel. And these are line segments because they have two endpoints. They each have two endpoints, and they continue forever. Well, they don't continue forever. They continue forever in no directions, in zero directions. If it was a ray, it would continue forever in one direction. If it's a line, it continues forever past both of these points. In fact, it wouldn't have endpoints because it would just continue forever in both of these directions. Let's do one more. Drag the ray so it has an endpoint at A. So we want to make its endpoint at A where the ray terminates, and goes through one of the other black points. The ray should also be parallel to the pink line. So I have two options. I can make it go through this black point, but it's clearly not parallel. In fact, it looks perpendicular here. So let's try to make it go through this point. Well, yes. When I do that, it does indeed look like my ray is parallel to the pink line. And this is a ray because it has one endpoint. This is where the ray terminates. It's an endpoint. It literally ends there. And it continues forever in one direction. In this case, the direction is to the right. It continues forever to the right. So it continues forever in one direction.\n",

      "What I want to do is think about whether this expression right over here would evaluate the same way whether or not we had parentheses. So to think about that, let's first think about how it would evaluate if we have the parentheses. So if we have the parentheses, we want to do whatever's in the parentheses first. And so here we have 8 minus 3, which is equal to 5. So this simplifies to 5 times 8 minus 3. And now we want to do the multiplication before we do subtraction. This goes back to order of operations. You do your multiplication and division first. Well, you do your parentheses first. Then if you have multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction all in a row, you want to do your multiplication and your division first. So here we're going to multiply 5 times 8 to get 40. And then we're going to subtract 3 to get 37. Now let's think about what this would evaluate to if we did not have the parentheses. So it would be 8 minus 3 times 8 minus 3. So we just have to remind ourselves about the order of operations. The convention is to do your multiplication first. So you're actually going to multiply the 3 times the 8 before you subtract it from this 8 and then before you subtract this 3. So we took away the parentheses, but the order of operations say, hey, do this multiplication first. We could even put a parentheses here to emphasize that. So this will become 8 minus 24. So let me write it this way, 8 minus 24 minus 3. Now 8 minus 24 is negative 16. You subtract another 3. You're going to get to negative 19. So clearly, you get very, very different values depending on whether or not you have parentheses.\n",

      "What I want to do is think about whether this expression right over here would evaluate the same way whether or not we had parentheses. So to think about that, let's first think about how it would evaluate if we have the parentheses. So if we have the parentheses, we want to do whatever's in the parentheses first. And so here we have 8 minus 3, which is equal to 5. So this simplifies to 5 times 8 minus 3. And now we want to do the multiplication before we do subtraction. This goes back to order of operations. You do your multiplication and division first. Well, you do your parentheses first. Then if you have multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction all in a row, you want to do your multiplication and your division first. So here we're going to multiply 5 times 8 to get 40. And then we're going to subtract 3 to get 37. Now let's think about what this would evaluate to if we did not have the parentheses. So it would be 8 minus 3 times 8 minus 3. So we just have to remind ourselves about the order of operations. The convention is to do your multiplication first. So you're actually going to multiply the 3 times the 8 before you subtract it from this 8 and then before you subtract this 3. So we took away the parentheses, but the order of operations say, hey, do this multiplication first. We could even put a parentheses here to emphasize that. So this will become 8 minus 24. So let me write it this way, 8 minus 24 minus 3. Now 8 minus 24 is negative 16. You subtract another 3. You're going to get to negative 19.

      "Let's give ourselves a little bit of practice with percentages. So let's ask ourselves, what percent, percent of, I don't know, let's say what percent of 16 is 4? And I encourage you to pause this video and to try it out yourself. So when you're saying what percent of 16 is 4, a percent is another way of saying what fraction of 16 is 4, and we just need to write it as a percent, as per 100. So if you said what fraction of 4 is, or what fraction of 16 is 4, you would say, well look this is the same thing as 4 16ths, which is the same thing as equal, this is the same thing as 1 4th. But this is saying what fraction 4 is of 16. You'd say, well 4 is 1 4th of 16. But it still doesn't answer our question. What percent, what percent. So in order to write this as a percent, we literally have to write it as something over 100. Percent literally means per cent. The word cent you know from cents and century. It relates to the number 100. So it's per 100. So you could say, well this is going to be equal to question mark over 100, the part of 100. And there's a bunch of ways that you could think about this. You could say, well look, if in the denominator I go from 4 to 100, I have to multiply by 25. In the numerator, to go from, I need to also multiply by 25 in order to have an equivalent fraction. So I'm also going to multiply by 25. So 1 4th is the same thing as 25 over 100. And another way of saying 25 over 100 is this is 25 per 100, or 25 per cent. So this is equal to 25 per cent. Now there's a couple of other ways you could have thought about it. You could have said, well 4 over 16, this is literally 4 divided by 16. Well let me just do the division and convert to a decimal, which is very easy to convert to a percentage. So let's try to actually do this division right over here. So we're going to literally divide 4 by 16. Now 16 goes into 4, 0 times. 0 times 16 is 0. You subtract and you get a 4. And we're not satisfied just having this remainder. We want to keep adding 0's to figure out what to get a decimal answer right over here. So let's put a decimal right over here. We're going into the tenths place. And let's throw some 0's right over here. The decimal makes sure we keep track of the fact that we are now in the tenths and then the hundredths and then the thousandths place if we have to go that far. But let's bring another 0 down. 16 goes into 40, goes into 40 2 times. 2 times 16 is 32. You subtract you get 8 and you could bring down another 0. And we have 16 goes into 80. Let's see, 16 goes into 80 5 times. 5 times 16 is 80. You subtract you have no remainder and you're done. 4 sixteenths is the same thing as 0.25. Now 0.25 is the same thing as 25 hundredths or this is the same thing as 25 over 100 which is the same thing as 25 percent.\n",

      "So let's assume that this entire square represents a whole. And we can see that part of it is shaded in, in blue. What we're going to do in this video is try to represent the part that is shaded in blue as a fraction, as a decimal, decimal, decimal, and as a percent. So pause the video and see if you can do that. Well, let's first think about it as a fraction. So the whole is split into one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10 equal sections. And six of them are filled in. So the blue represents 6 tenths of a whole, or represents, you could just say 6 tenths. And you could also rewrite that if you divide the numerator and the denominator by two, that's the same thing as three over five. Fair enough? Now let's represent it as a decimal. What decimal would it be? Pause the video again and see if you can do that. Well, 6 tenths, we could literally just go to our place value. So that's the ones place, we have a decimal. And then you have your tenths place. And so we have 6 tenths, so you could just put it right over there. We are putting a six in the tenths place to represent 6 tenths. Now what about a percentage? Well, percent means per hundred. So one way to think about it is, six over 10 is the same thing as what per hundred? That is equal to, if we multiply the numerator and the denominator by 10, that's the same thing as 60 per hundred. Or another way of thinking about it, 60 per, instead of hundred, you could say cent. And so this would be equal to, this would be equal to 60%. Let's do another example. So here, once again, our entire square represents a whole. So see if you can represent this as the part that's shaded in blue as a fraction. Pause the video and do that. Well, you can see that this is a 10 by 10 grid. So there's 100 equal sections here. 100 equal sections. Each of these squares represents 1 hundredth. And how many of them are there? Let's see, this row is 10, 20, 30, 40, and then one, two, three, four. So this is 44 over 100, 44 hundredths. And we could actually represent this in other ways. We could divide the numerator and the denominator by four. In which case, you would get 11 over 25. That's another way to represent this same fraction. Now, what about as a decimal? Well, 44 hundredths, you could say, well, you have your ones place, and then this is the same thing. You literally just say this is 44 hundredths. This is another way of representing 44 hundredths. It's 4 tenths, and 4 hundredths is 44 hundredths. And then if you were to do a percent, well, this is 44 per 100, or 44 hundredths. But even here, I like looking at it as 44 per 100, or 44 per cent. So this is going to be 44 per cent. And we're done.\n",

      "The amount of rain that falls in various cities in France varies. The line plot below shows the average monthly rainfall in 13 different cities. Measurements are rounded to the nearest 1 fourth of a centimeter. How much more rain falls in the rainiest city than the second rainiest city? So let's make sure we understand what they're calling a line plot right over here. Each of these dots represents one of the cities whose average monthly rainfall was measured. And so for example, putting this dot here shows that this is the only city that had 6 centimeters of average monthly rainfall. Here, this shows that there were two cities that had an average monthly rainfall of, looks like, 8 and 3 fourths centimeters. There were two cities that had an average monthly rainfall of 12 and 3 fourths centimeters. So at any given amount of rainfall, it's essentially showing you how many cities had that amount of rainfall on average per month. Now that we understand this diagram, let's answer the question. How much more rain falls in the rainiest city? So the rainiest city here, well, there's only one city that's up here at 13 and 1 half centimeters of rainfall. So this right over here, let me mark this off. This is 13 and 1 half centimeters. How much more rain falls in the rainiest city than the second rainiest city? Well, this is the second rainiest city is this city right over here. This is 13 and 1 fourth centimeter. So the average, the difference between the two is just one notch here, is just one notch, going from 13 and 1 fourth to 13 and 1 half. So one notch right over here, we see that there's four notches per centimeter, one notch over here. Is 1 fourth of a centimeter. So just looking at it, you could say that the difference is 1 fourth of a centimeter. Now, if it wasn't so clear, because here we're just looking one notch right over here, you could take the larger of the two and subtract from that the smaller of the two. So you could take 13 and 1 half, and from that, subtract 13 and 1 fourth. And there's multiple ways of doing this. You could subtract the 13 from the 13, and then subtract the 1 fourth from the 1 half, and then you would get 1 fourth. And other ways, you could convert these both into improper fractions. So 13 and 1 half is the same thing as 2 times 13 is 26, plus 1 is 27. So that's 27 over 2. And then we could say minus, see, 4 times 13 is 52, plus 1 is 53, so minus 53 over 4. And then in order to do the subtraction, you have to have the same denominator. And so 4 is a multiple of 2, so we just have to multiply the numerator and denominator here by 2. So we have 54 over 4 minus 53 over 4, which is equal to, well, 54 minus 53 is 1 over 4, 1 fourth of a centimeter. For this problem, this would clearly be a little bit too much that you would have to do, but this is useful to know just in case it wasn't as obvious that these weren't just next to each other.\n",

      "Which shapes are symmetrical? To answer this, we need to know what it means for a shape to be symmetrical. A shape is symmetrical if it has at least one line of symmetry, a line of symmetry. And now that answer is only helpful if we know what a line of symmetry is. So let's talk about it. A line of symmetry is a line where we can fold the image and have both halves match exactly. Let's look at an example. Let's draw, let's say we draw a circle and then we can put a line on that circle. Let's draw a line maybe somewhere like this. This line is a line of symmetry if we can take one side of the line and fold it onto the other and have them match exactly. So let's take one side, doesn't matter which one, let's say the top side. And if we were gonna fold this top side down onto the bottom, would it match exactly what is shown under here? Let's see, it would probably look something like this. And does that match exactly? No, definitely not. So this is not a line of symmetry. Let's try another line. Maybe if we drew a line and we'll try to get as close down the center as we can here, like this. Try to be as close to the center as possible. And here if we took one side, again it doesn't matter which side, let's say over here, let's say the left side. And we folded this left side onto the right side, would it match exactly? And if our line truly was in the center of the circle, then yes, it would, which means that this line is a line of symmetry. And because we can draw this line of symmetry on our circle, it means that our circle is symmetrical. Shapes are symmetrical if they have at least one line of symmetry. And circles have many, many, many lines of symmetry. There was many places we could have drawn a line and folded it so that it worked, so the two halves matched exactly. But here's one, and as soon as we find one, we know we have a symmetrical shape. So let's go back to the shapes we were given. We can start with the triangle. If we draw a line, maybe a vertical line, let's try to draw it as close to the middle as possible, something like this. And we fold, let's take one side, if we fold this side over, these two lines might match up nicely, but this line here is gonna create something more like this, which does not match what's shown over here, so that's not a line of symmetry. And anywhere else vertical, same thing, we're not gonna have it lined up. So let's try maybe a horizontal line. Is there anywhere horizontally we could draw a line? And again, I think we're gonna see the same thing, that the top and the bottom of the line are not gonna match up exactly. So maybe one last thing we could try is a diagonal line, something like this. Maybe this could be our line of symmetry. If we fold this bottom side, this might line up pretty nice here, and then this side is gonna do something like this. So it's close, it's the closest we've gotten, but still does not match exactly. For it to be a line of symmetry, it needs to match exactly. So we weren't able to find a way to draw a vertical line or a horizontal line or even a diagonal line, so this shape has no lines of symmetry, so we can say it is not symmetrical. Moving on to the rectangle, let's try here again. This time maybe we'll try a horizontal line. We can draw one right here. And if that line truly is in the middle, which is what I've tried for, then this side should match up nicely to this one. Across the top should match across the bottom, and these sides, if I was right at the halfway point, should fold over each other also. So it has a line of symmetry, so it is symmetrical. It has more than one line of symmetry. It has another one in the middle right here, but once we've found one, we know that it's symmetrical. And finally, let's look. We have a pentagon here again. Trying a line in the middle in some way is usually a good place to start. We can try to draw a line right, if this is right down the center here. Then if we folded this side, should line up nicely to this side. This side and this side would overlap, and these two would match exactly. So again, has one line of symmetry, so it is symmetrical. And just like the rectangle, this one had quite a few lines of symmetry. Here's another line of symmetry. Here's another line of symmetry. Here's one more line of symmetry. And so it has quite a few. It has, it looks like one, two, three, four lines of symmetry, but as long as it has one, it is symmetrical. So of the shapes we were given, the rectangle and the pentagon were symmetrical.\n",

So if we look over here, we can see that here on this horizontal axis when we're going from the left to right, it says hours of exercise, so half an hour, one hour, one and a half hours, two hours, two and a half hours. And then here it shows hours of screen time. So for example, it looks like Liu Yang did zero hours of exercise, did no exercise, and spent seven hours in front of a screen. Not something that I would recommend. And it looks like Kavitha spent half an hour, had half an hour of exercise on Thursday. This is all describing what happens on Thursday. And had five and a half hours of screen time. You see that right over there. And we could keep going with all the other data points. But let's see what they're asking us. What is the meaning of the point marked Maxime? I think that's how I would pronounce that. So Maxime is right over here. And it looks like this is the point one, because our horizontal coordinate right over here is one, and then our vertical coordinate is four. So point one comma four.

      "What I want to do in this video is think about the difference between a line segment, a line segment, a line, a line, and a ray, and a ray. And this is kind of the pure geometrical versions of these things. And so a line segment is actually probably what most of us associate with a line in our everyday lives. So a line segment is something just like that, for lack of a better word, a straight line. But why we call it a segment is that it actually has a starting and a stopping point. So most of the lines that we experience in our everyday reality are actually line segments when we think of it from a pure geometrical point of view. And I know I drew a little bit of a curve here, but this is supposed to be completely straight. But it's a line segment. The segment is based on the fact that it has a ending point and a starting point, or a starting point and an ending point. A line, if you're thinking about it in the pure geometric sense of a line, essentially, it does not stop. It does not have a starting point and an ending point. It keeps going on forever in both directions. So a line would look like this. And to show that it keeps on going on forever in that direction right over there, we draw this arrow. And to keep showing that it goes on forever in kind of the down left direction, we draw this arrow right over here. So obviously, I've never encountered something that just keeps on going straight forever. But that's the neat thing about math. We can think about these abstract notions. And so the mathematical, purest geometric sense of a line is this straight thing that goes on forever. Now, a ray is something in between. A ray has a well-defined starting point. So that's its starting point. But then it just keeps on going on forever. So the ray might start over here, but then it just keeps on going. And it just keeps on going. So that right over there is a ray. Now, with that out of the way, let's actually try to do the Khan Academy module on recognizing the difference between line segments, lines, and rays. And I think you'll find it pretty straightforward based on our little classification right over here. So let me get the module going. Let me, where did I put it? There you go. All right. So what is this thing right over here? Well, it has two arrows on both ends. So it's implying that it goes on forever. So this is going to be a line. Let's check our answer. Yeah, it's a line. Now, it's taking some time. I'll correct next question. All right. Now, what about this thing? Once again, arrows on both sides means that this thing is going to go on forever in both directions. So once again, it is a line. Fair enough. Let's do another one. Here, we have one arrow. So it goes on forever in this direction. But it has a well-defined starting point. So it starts there and then goes on forever. And if you remember, that's what a ray is. One starting point, but goes on forever. Or one way to think about it, it goes on forever in only one direction. So that is a ray. So let's do another question. This right over here, you have a starting point and an ending point. Or you could call this the start point and the ending point. But it doesn't go on forever in either direction. So this right over here is a line segment. There you go. So hopefully, that gives you enough to work your way through this module. And you might notice, when I did this module right here, there is no video. And that's exactly what this video is. It's the video for this module.\n",

      "What I want to explore in this video is the notion of a rate. So let's look at some examples of rates that you've probably encountered in your everyday life. So if you're driving in your car down the road and you're looking at the speedometer, you might see that it says that you are going 35 MPH, where the MPH stands for 35 miles per hour. Well, what's that saying? That's saying, well, every hour, how many miles are you going? If you were to stay at that current rate. So it could be a measure of speed. How much distance are you covering per unit time? And most typically when people talk about rates, that's what they're talking about. They're talking about how much of something that is happening per unit time. And it doesn't have to be even distance per unit time. You might have your hourly rate for someone who's doing some type of a job. They might say that they're making $10. So they're making $10. And actually, let me write the dollars out so the units become a little bit more obvious. $10 per hour. And so once again, this is how much money, it's not talking about distance anymore, how much money is being earned per unit time. And so even though rates are often associated with how much something is happening per some unit time, it could be miles per hour. It could be meters per second. Or in this case, it could be your wage. It could be dollars per hour. Rates don't have to be just in those terms. In fact, you might say, all right, I have a dessert that I really enjoy, but I'm very conscientious about the number of calories that I consume. And you might see something like there are 200 calories per serving. And so this is telling us the number of calories per serving. And they'll tell us what a serving is. A serving might be a cup or eight ounces or whatever else. And so I could say, okay, look, if I have two servings, then I'm going to have 400 calories. Same way if I work two hours, I'm going to have $20. Or if I go two hours, I'm going to go 70 miles. So rates give you a sense. It's like how fast is something happening or how much of one thing is happening for every time something else happens. Now, I can write rates so they look an awful lot like a ratio. And these words are actually very related because you see that even how they're written, R-A-T, R-A-T. Their roots are coming from the exact same idea. In fact, this rate over here, 35 miles per hour, it could come from, hey, I just went 35 miles in one hour. What's the ratio? So the ratio of miles to hours. And then you could say, well, I went 35. The ratio of miles to hours was 35 to one. Or it could have been, maybe it was 70 to two or something like that. But that could have been reduced to 35 to one. So as a ratio, you would typically see it written like this or maybe see it written like this. And sometimes you might even see it written like this, 35 miles to one hour. But now it's starting to resemble more of the special case of a ratio, which we call a rate because this is the same thing as 35. Instead of writing it out miles per hour, you'll often see it written like this, miles per hour. So these are very, very related ideas. If you find the ratio between calories and servings, well, then you're going to be able to write, you are going to be able to express it as a rate and vice versa. Now, why do we care about rates? Well, especially if we're thinking about things like speed, without rates, it'd be hard to quantify how fast things are happening. Otherwise, we'd be in a world where we're saying, hey, I'm faster than you or she's faster than me, but we wouldn't be able to quantify exactly how fast they are. But with rates, we can say, hey, that person ran 100 meters in 10 seconds. They run 10 meters per second. We can quantify exactly how fast that thing is happening, the rate at which it is happening. Here, instead of saying, hey, a cup of that is going to give you more energy or maybe contribute more to your weight than a cup of that and making these relative comparisons, here you can actually quantify things. When we study rate, we're going to study rate a lot in mathematics. It's going to be essential in algebra when we look at the rate of change of a line, how far it moves in the vertical direction relative to the horizontal direction. We're going to call that slope. You can even imagine a slope of a hill is kind of how fast is it climbing for as much as you move forward. But we're also going to study rates in detail when we go to calculus. In fact, the whole basis of differential calculus that you might see later in high school and early college is all about measuring instantaneous rate, how fast is something going right now. Rates are really, really interesting, really, really important. I would guess that if you just look around your life, even over the next few hours, you're going to encounter many, many, many rates.\n",

      "We've got some apples here and we've got some oranges. And what I want to think about is what is the ratio, what is the ratio of apples, of apples to oranges, to oranges. And to clarify what we're even talking about, a ratio is giving us the relationship between quantities of two different things. So there's a couple of ways that we can specify this. We can literally count the number of apples, one, two, three, four, five, six. So we have six apples. And we could say the ratio is going to be six to, six to, and then how many oranges do we have? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. It is six to nine. Ratio of apples to oranges is six to nine. And you could use different notation. You could also write it this way. Six to, you would still read it as the ratio as being six to nine. But we don't have to just satisfy us with this because one way to think about ratios, if especially we're thinking about apples to oranges, is how many apples do we have for a certain number of oranges? And when you think about it that way, we can actually reduce these numbers as you might have already thought about. Both six and nine are divisible by three. So just like we can reduce fractions, we can also reduce ratios. So if you divide six and nine both by three, six divided by three is two. Six divided by three is two. And nine divided by three is three. So we could also say that the ratio of apples to oranges is two to three. Or if we want to use this notation, two to three. Two to three. Now does that make sense? Well look, we divided each of these groups into three. So one way to think about it, so if you divide this whole total into three groups, so one group, one group, two groups, two groups, and three equal groups, we see that in each of those groups, for every two apples, for every two apples, we have three oranges. For two apples, we have three oranges. For two apples, we have three oranges. So once again, the ratio of apples to oranges for every two apples, we have three oranges. But we could think about things the other way around as well. We could also think about what is the ratio, we could also think about what is the ratio, ratio of oranges to apples. Oranges to apples. And here we would essentially switch the numbers. The ratio of oranges to apples. Notice, up here we said apples to oranges, which is six to nine, or two to three if we reduce them. And here we're gonna say the ratio of oranges to apples. So we've swapped these two, and so we're going to swap the numbers. Here we have nine oranges for every six apples, so we could say the ratio is going to be nine to six. The ratio is nine to six. Or if we want to reduce it, for every three oranges, so we're gonna divide this by three, so for every three oranges, we are going to have two apples. We are going to have two apples. So notice, this is just exactly what we had up here, but when we had apples to oranges, it was six to nine, six apples for every nine oranges. And now when it's oranges to apples, we say it's nine to six. Nine oranges for every six apples. Or we could say for every three oranges, we have exactly two apples.\n",

      "You are probably familiar with the notion of a number line where we can take a number and associate it with a point on the number line. So, for example, the number two, I would start at zero and I'd go one, two to the right, and I would end up right over there. What we're going to do in this video is think about how do we take two numbers and associate them with a point on a plane like this. So, for example, you might have the two numbers three comma five. How does that, or how can these two numbers be represented as a point on the plane, or how can these tell you where a point on the plane is? So, let's first get a little bit of terminology out of the way. So, what we have here, this is often known as our coordinate plane. These two numbers you could view as our coordinates. Let me write this down. These are our coordinates. These black lines are known as the axes. Each one is an axis, and the one that goes left right here, this is known as the x-axis, or it's typically known as the x-axis. In the future, it might be called other things. And the one that goes up down in the vertical direction, this is typically known as the y-axis. As you go further in math, we might call it other things, but most of the time, it's going to be called the y-axis. So, how does three comma five, how do these coordinates specify a point on this plane? Well, the way that we typically work it through, the standard way that people will interpret these points, is they'll say, all right, this first coordinate, this is our x-coordinate. This is our x-coordinate. You can view it as how far do we move to the right along the x-axis? So, what you would do is you'd say, all right, I'm gonna start right here where my axes intersect, and I'm going to go three to the right, one, two, three. So, my x-coordinate says, all right, my point is going to be this far to the right, this far to the right. So, it's gonna be somewhere on this vertical line, this dotted line that I'm showing. Everything on this vertical line has an x-coordinate of three. Now, what's the y-coordinate? Or another way I should say it, the second number right over here, this is the y-coordinate, y-coordinate. This tells us how far do we move up. So, one way to think about it, you could start back at where the axes intersect. This point is actually called the origin. Let me write that down, that is the origin. And so, starting at the origin, move five up, one, two, three, four, five. So, everything on this horizontal line that I'm drawing has a y-coordinate of five. So, what point uniquely has both an x-coordinate of three and a y-coordinate of five? Well, you can see where those two lines intersect, right over here. Actually, let me do that same blue color that I wrote the coordinates in. So, this point right over here, it has an x-coordinate of three and it has a y-coordinate of five. That is the point three comma five. Now, what is the coordinates of the origin? Well, the origin is zero to the right of the origin and it's also zero above the origin. So, the coordinates there, the x-coordinate is zero, the y-coordinate is also zero. Let's do a few more examples. So, let's say that I wanted to plot the point two comma five. Why don't you pause this, or let me use a different number, two comma four. Why don't you pause this video and think about where that point would be on this coordinate plane? All right, let's do it together. So, the first number is going to be our x-coordinate. It tells us how far do we move to the right. So, we move two to the right and then our second number says how far do we move up. First, we're gonna move two to the right and then we are going to move four up. So, you can say one, two to the right and then one, two, three, four right over there. This right over here is the point two comma four. Notice, it's x-coordinate, how far to the right of the origin it is, that is two, and it's y-coordinate, how far above the origin is, that is four. Now, let's go the other way around. Let's say that I were to give you, if I were to give you this point right over here, what would its coordinates be? Pause the video and try to figure that out. All right, well, we know it's going to be two numbers, so I'll do something comma something. Now, the first something, that's going to be our x-coordinate. You could think of it as what point on the x-axis are we above? You could think about how far to the right of the origin we are, and you can see that your x-coordinate right over here is, if we just drop a vertical line straight down from that point, it hits the x-axis at four. So, that is four. Another way to think about it, we're one, two, three, four to the right of the y-axis. Now, how high are we? How high above the x-axis are we? Well, we're one above the x-axis, so this is going to be four comma one. Another way to think about it, if you just take a line and you go straight to the left, you're going to hit the y-axis at the one right over here. So, the coordinates here are four comma one. Now, just so we don't get confused, and when you first learn this, the main point of confusion is remembering that, okay, the first number is the x-coordinate, the second number is the y-coordinate. One comma four would be a different point. One comma four would be, okay, one in the x-direction, and then four in the y-direction. So, this is one comma four over here. So, it's very important to realize that the standard way of interpreting these numbers is that the first one says, how far do you move to the right of the origin, or how far do you move along the x-axis, or where are you on the x-axis? And the second number is, how far do you move in the vertical direction, or where are you relative to the y, or where are you in the vertical direction?\n",

      "Below are ordered pairs that represent the first six terms of two given patterns. The first value in each pair is a term from pattern A, and the second value is a term from pattern B. In the answer box, there are different statements about the two patterns. Choose all correct statements. So let's think about what's going on here. They said the first term is pattern A. So pattern A, the first, so the first term in each of these coordinates is pattern A, or in each pair is pattern A. So pattern A goes from 1, to 2, to 4, to 8, to 16, to 32. So it looks like pattern A, to go from the first term to the second term, we multiplied by 2, and then to go from the second to the third term, we also multiplied by 2. And we just keep multiplying by 2. And we just keep doing that. 8 times 2 is 16. 16 times 2 is 32. Now let's think about what's going on with pattern B. So pattern B is the second number in each of these pairs. And it's just always 3. So there's a couple of ways you think about it. You could just say pattern B is always 3. You could say pattern B starts at 3, and we're just adding 0 every time. Or you could say that pattern B starts at 3, and we are multiplying by 1 every time. Either of those would give you just 3 showing up over and over again, over and over again. So now that we've looked at these pairs, which show the corresponding terms for pattern A and pattern B, let's look at the choices here and see which of these apply. In pattern A, you can get from any term to the next by multiplying by a constant number. Well, that looks right. We go from the first term to the second term by multiplying by 2. Then we multiply by 2 again to get to the third term. So that constant number that we're multiplying by to get to the next term is 2. So this looks right. The next pair should be 52 comma 3. So let's think about this. If we keep doubling for pattern A, so this is going to be times 2. 32 times 2 is 64. And then if we say that this is 1 times the previous term, we're just going to get a 3 again. So it should be 64 comma 3 should be the next one. They say the next pair should be 52 comma 3. So that's not right. If we graph the pairs, the points will be on the same line. So let's think about that a little bit. Let's think about that. So this is my vertical axis. This is my horizontal axis. On the horizontal axis, I will graph pattern A. And on my vertical axis, I will graph pattern B. Let's see, pattern A goes all the way up to 32. So I'm going to try my best here. So let's say that this is 32. Then half of that is going to be 16. Half of that is going to be 8. Half of that is going to be 4. Half of that is going to be 2. And half of that is going to be 1. So these are all the points on pattern A. But for any of them, the corresponding term on pattern B is 3. So when pattern A is 1, pattern B is 3. 1, 3. When pattern A is 2, pattern B is 3. When pattern A is 4, pattern B is 3. When pattern A is 8, pattern B is 3. This is like a tongue twister. When pattern A is 16, pattern B is 3. When pattern A is 32, pattern B is 3. And you see, they all sit on a line. They all sit on the line. They all sit on this horizontal line, or at least the way that we've drawn it. They all sit on this line that you probably can't see in yellow. So let me do it in this red color. They all sit on this line right over here. So this looks right. If we graph the pairs, the points will be on the same line. So I'll go with that one. In pattern B, you can get from any term to the next by multiplying by a constant number. Well, yeah, even though every term is the same term, but you can get from a 3 to a 3 by always multiplying by 1. 1 is a constant number. So we're just multiplying every term by 1. So that also seems to be right. So all of these are right except the second one. The next pair isn't 52 comma 3. It's going to be 64 comma 3.\n",

      "The following graph represents the first five terms of two given patterns. In the answer box, there are different statements about the two patterns. Choose all correct statements. So here for each point, this point right over here, this represents its horizontal coordinate is the first term of pattern A, which is 4. And its vertical coordinate is the first term in pattern B, which is 1. And then we could do that for the other points as well. So actually, let's figure out what the values are. So we have pattern A, and then we have pattern B. So the first term for pattern A is 4. And when pattern A is 4, the first term for pattern B is 1. The second term for pattern A is 7. And when pattern A is 7, pattern B is also 7. Third term, pattern A is 10, and pattern B is 13. And then fourth term, pattern A is 13, and pattern B is 19. And then finally, fifth term, pattern A is 16, and pattern B is 25. Now before even looking at these, let's see what we can think about these patterns here. So it looks like pattern A starts at 4, and it increases by 3 every time. To go from one term to the next, you just have to add 3. Now what about for pattern B? Well, pattern B starts at 1, and every term here looks like you're adding 6. When pattern A increases by 3, and we're moving in the horizontal direction, based on the fact that pattern A is represented on the horizontal axis, we're going to move up 6 in the vertical axis. And we see that here. Pattern A increases by 3 from one term to the next. And when that increased by 3, pattern B increased by 6 from one term to the next. And we see that it keeps doing that. Now let's think about what we have over here to see which of these statements actually apply to this. For every term in pattern A, multiply the term by 2, and then subtract 7 to get the corresponding term from pattern B. So let's see if that holds up. So according to this, if this was true, I should be able to take this, multiply by 2, and subtract 7, and get that. So let's see. Is 1 equal to 2 times 4 minus 7? So 2 times this number, 2 times 4 minus 7. Well, 8 minus 7 is equal to 1. Is this right over here equal to 2 times this 7 minus 7? Well, yeah, it's equal to 7. Is 13 equal to 2 times 10 minus 7? Yeah, 20 minus 7 is 13. Is 19 equal to 2 times 13 minus 7? 26 minus 7 is 19. Is 25 equal to 2 times 16 minus 7? Well, 32 minus 7 is 25. So this first statement checks out. For the corresponding term, the value of pattern B is 2 times the value of pattern A minus 7. Now let's look at the second one. The terms of pattern B are always greater than or equal to their corresponding terms from pattern A. Well, no, that's not right. It's true for a couple of scenarios. Here, for the third, fourth, and fifth term, or actually for the second, third, and fourth, second, third, fourth, and fifth terms, pattern B is equal to or greater than pattern A. But for the first term, it's not true. Pattern A is greater. So this is not right. To get from each point to the next, you need to move 3 units to the right and 6 units up. Well, that's exactly what we talked about. From one term to the next, pattern A, along our horizontal axis, we increase by 3, while pattern B, which is plotted on our vertical axis, by 6. So you move 3 to the right and 6 up. So that is right. The second terms of both patterns are 7. Well, yeah, we see that right over here. The second terms are 7. We have 7 here, and we have 7 there. And so that is right as well. So the only one that doesn't apply is this second one. This is not right.\n",

For every term of pattern A, so they give us the terms of pattern A here, multiply the term by 3 and add 1 to get the corresponding term of pattern B. Then graph the pairs of corresponding terms. So for every term in pattern A, we want to multiply by 3 and add 1. So if we multiply 0 by 3, we get 0, and you add 1, you get 1. You multiply 1 by 3, you get 3, and then you add 1, you get 4. 2 times 3 is 6, plus 1 is 7. 3 times 3 is 9, plus 1 is 10.

So let's try to graph these points. So when pattern A is 0, pattern B is 1. When pattern A is 0, so this is pattern A equaling 0. That's our horizontal axis, the value of pattern A. Pattern B is the value of our vertical axis. Pattern B is 1. When pattern A is 1, pattern B is 4. So it's 1, 4. So when pattern A is 1, pattern B is 4. Pattern B is on the vertical axis.

And then finally, when pattern A is 4, pattern B is 13. Now let's just look at these patterns. We see pattern A is increasing by 1 each time, while pattern A starts at 0 and increases by 1, while pattern B starts at 1 and increases by 3, which makes complete sense. It starts at 1 because all of these you multiply by 3 and add 1. So you start at 1, and then the fact that we're multiplying by 3, that's what's leading to the distance between these points being 3.

      "Let's think a little bit about two terms that you will see throughout your geometry and really mathematical career. One is the idea of things being perpendicular, and usually people are talking about perpendicular, actually, let me, I'm misspelling it, perpendicular, perpendicular lines, normally perpendicular lines, and the idea of parallel lines, parallel, parallel lines. So perpendicular lines are two lines that intersect at a right angle. So what am I talking about? So let's say that this is one line right over here, and that this is another line right over here. We would say these two lines are perpendicular if they intersect at a right angle. So they clearly intersect. In order for them to intersect at a right angle, the angle formed between these two lines needs to be 90 degrees, and if any one of these angles is 90 degrees, the rest of them are going to be 90 degrees. So if this is 90 degrees, then these are perpendicular lines, and if that's 90 degrees, then that's going to be 90 degrees, that's going to be 90 degrees, and that's going to be 90 degrees. So if any of them are 90 degrees, the rest of them are 90 degrees, and we have perpendicular lines. If you have two lines that, on a two dimensional surface like your paper or like the screen, never intersect, they stay the same distance apart, then we are talking about parallel lines. So this line right over here, and this line right over here, the way I've drawn them, are parallel lines. They aren't intersecting. They're both kind of going in the same direction, but they're kind of shifted versions of each other. They will never intersect with each other. So these two are parallel. If we have two lines that, let's say they intersect, but they don't intersect at a right angle, so let's say we have that line, and we have this line right over here, and they're clearly not intersecting at a right angle, then we call these neither perpendicular nor parallel lines. These lines just intersect.\n",

      "So we're told the square below represents one whole. So this entire square is a whole. And then they ask us what percent is represented by the shaded area. So why don't you pause this video and see if you can figure that out. So let's see, the whole is divided into one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10 equal sections of which one, two, three, four, five, six, seven are actually filled in, that's the shaded area. So one way to think about it is 7 tenths are shaded in. But how do we express this fraction as a percent? They're asking for a percent. Well remember, per cent, it literally means per hundred. Cent, same root as the word hundred. You see it in cents or century. And so can we write this as per hundred instead of per 10? Well seven per 10 is the same thing as 70 per hundred. Or 70 per cent. And how did I go from 7 tenths to 70 over 100? Well I just multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 10. And once you do more and more percents, you'll get a hang of it. You say oh, 7 tenths, that's the same thing as 70 per 100 which is 70 per cent. Let's do another example. Here we're told 100 per cent is shown on the following tape diagram. So just this amount right over here is 100 per cent. And then they ask us what per cent is represented by the entire tape diagram? So by this entire thing right over here. Pause this video and see if you can answer that. Well one way to think about 100 per cent, 100 per cent is equivalent to a whole. And now we have three times as much of that for the entire tape diagram. So you could view this as three wholes or you could say that's 100 per cent. We have another 100 per cent right over here. And then we have another 100 per cent right over here. So the whole tape diagram, that would be 300 per cent. Let's do another example. This is strangely fun. Okay, and I'll see it says the large rectangle below represents one whole. All right, so that's this whole thing is one whole. What percentage is represented by the shaded area? So pause the video and see if you can figure that out again. So let's just express it as a fraction first. So we have a total of one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 squares. So out of those 20 squares, we see that six of them are actually shaded in. So 6 20ths, can we write that as per 100? Well, let's see. To go from 20 to 100, I multiply by five. And so if I multiply, so if I multiply the numerator by five, I'll get the same value. Six times five is 30. So six per 20 is the same thing as 30 per 100, which is the same thing as 30 per cent, which literally means per 100. So this is 30%. Let's do one last example. Here we are told each large rectangle below represents one whole. So this is a whole, and then this whole thing right over here is another whole. What percentage is represented by the shaded area? Again, pause the video. See if you can answer that. So this one, we have shaded in a whole, so that is 100%. And then over here, we have shaded in one, two, three, 4 5ths of the whole. So 4 5ths, if I wanted to express it as per 100, what would it be? Well, five times 20 is 100. So four times 20 is 80. So 4 5ths, or 80 hundredths, is filled out here, where you could say 80 per 100, which is the same thing as 80%. So this right over here is 80%. So what percent is represented by the shaded area? Well, we have 100%, and then we have 80%. So we have 180%. It's more than a whole. If you have a percentage that is larger than 100%, you're talking about something that is more than a whole, and then we see that. We have a whole right over here, and then we have 80% more than that.\n",

      "Let's get some practice comparing and computing rates. So they tell us the pet store has three fish tanks, each holding a different volume of water and a different number of fish. So tank A has five fish and it has 40 liters of water, tank B, 12 fish, 100 liters of water, and tank C, 23 fish, and it has 180 liters of water. Order the tanks by volume per fish from least to greatest. So let's think about what volume per fish, and we could think about this as volume divided by fish. Volume per fish. All right, so here for tank A, it's going to be 40, 40 liters, 40 liters for every five fish. 40 for every five fish. And let's see, 40 over five is eight. So you have eight liters per fish is the rate at which they have to add water per fish for tank A. Now, tank B, you have 100, 100 liters for 12, for 12 fish. So what is this going to be? This is going to be, 12 goes into 100 eight times, so eight times 12 is 96, and then you have four left over. So this is going to be eight and 412, so eight and 1 3rd liters per fish. And all I did is I converted this improper fraction, 100 over 12, to a mixed number, and I simplified it. 12 goes into 100 eight times with a remainder of four, so it's eight and 412, so it's the same thing as eight and 1 3rd. And then finally, in tank C, I have 180 liters for 23, for 23 fish. So what is this going to be? 23 goes into 180. Let me actually try to calculate this. 23 goes into 180. It looks like it's going to be less than nine times. Is it eight times? Eight times, no, not eight times. Let's see, seven times. Seven times three is 21. Seven times two is 14, plus two is 16. When you subtract, you get a remainder of 19. So this is going to be seven with a remainder of 19, or you could say this is seven and 19 2 3rds liters per fish. Liters per fish. So which one has, we're going to order the tanks by volume per fish, from least to greatest. So tank B has the largest volume per fish, has eight and 1 3rd liters per fish, so this is in first place. And then tank A is in second place. Tank A is in second place. And then tank C is in third place. Oh, actually, we want to go from least to greatest. So this is, let me write it this way. Tank C is the least, and tank A is the greatest. Is the greatest. So we really have to swap this order around. Now, I just copied and pasted this from the Khan Academy exercises. Let me actually bring the actual exercise up, and I can rearrange it. C was the least, and B was the most. And we check our answer, and we got it right.\n",

      "What I want to do in this video is give an overview of quadrilaterals, and you can imagine from this prefix, or I guess you could say the beginning of this word quad, this involves four of something, and quadrilaterals, as you can imagine, are shapes, and we're going to be talking about two-dimensional shapes, that have four sides and four vertices and four angles. So, for example, 1, 2, 3, 4. That is a quadrilateral. Although that last slide didn't look too straight. 1, 2, 3, 4. That is a quadrilateral. 1, 2, 3, 4. These are all quadrilaterals. They all have four sides, four vertices, and clearly four angles. One angle, two angles, three angles, and four angles. Here you could measure, actually let me draw this one a little bit bigger, because it's interesting. So in this one right over here, you have one angle, two angles, three angles, and then you have this really big angle right over there. If you look at the interior angles of this quadrilateral. Now quadrilaterals, as you can imagine, can be subdivided into other groups based on the properties of the quadrilaterals. And the main subdivision of quadrilaterals is between concave and convex quadrilaterals. So you have concave, and you have convex. And the way I remember concave quadrilaterals, or really concave polygons of any number of shapes, is that it looks like something has caved in. So for example, this is a concave quadrilateral. It looks like this side has been caved in. And one way to define concave quadrilaterals, so let me draw it a little bit bigger. So this right over here is a concave quadrilateral, is that it has an interior angle that is larger than 180 degrees. So for example, this interior angle right over here is larger than 180 degrees. It's an interesting proof, maybe I'll do a video, it's actually a pretty simple proof, to show that if you have a concave quadrilateral, if at least one of the interior angles has a measure larger than 180 degrees, that none of the sides can be parallel to each other. The other type of quadrilateral, you can imagine, is when all of the interior angles are less than 180 degrees. And you might say, wait, what happens at 180 degrees? Well, if this angle was 180 degrees, then these wouldn't be two different sides, it would just be one side and that would look like a triangle. But if all of the interior angles are less than 180 degrees, then you are dealing with a convex quadrilateral. So this convex quadrilateral would involve that one and that one over there. So this right over here is what a convex quadrilateral, this is what a convex quadrilateral could look like. Four points, four sides, four angles. Now within convex quadrilaterals, there are some other interesting categorizations. So now we're just going to focus on convex quadrilaterals, so that's going to be all of the space over here. So one type of convex quadrilateral is a trapezoid. And a trapezoid is a convex quadrilateral, and sometimes the definition here is a little bit, different people will use different definitions. So some people will say a trapezoid is a quadrilateral that has exactly two sides that are parallel to each other. So for example, they would say that this right over here, this right over here is a trapezoid, where this side is parallel to that side. If I give it some letters here, if I call this trapezoid ABCD, we could say that segment AB is parallel to segment DC, and because of that we know that this is a trapezoid. Now I said that the definition is a little fuzzy, because some people say you can have exactly one pair of parallel sides, but some people say at least one pair of parallel sides. So if you use the original definition, and that's the kind of thing that most people are referring to when they say a trapezoid, exactly one pair of parallel sides, it might be something like this. But if you use the broader definition of at least one pair of parallel sides, then maybe this could also be considered a trapezoid. So you have one pair of parallel sides like that, and then you have another pair of parallel sides like that. So this is a question mark where it comes to a trapezoid. A trapezoid is definitely this thing here, where you have exactly one pair of parallel sides. Depending on people's definition, this may or may not be a trapezoid. If you say it's exactly one pair of parallel sides, this is not a trapezoid because it has two pairs. If you say at least one pair of parallel sides, then this is a trapezoid. So I'll put that in a little question mark there. But there is a name for this, regardless of your definition of what a trapezoid is. If you have a quadrilateral with two pairs of parallel sides, you are then dealing with a parallelogram. So the one thing that you definitely can call this is a parallelogram. And I'll just draw it a little bit bigger. So it's a quadrilateral. If I have a quadrilateral, and if I have two pairs of parallel sides, or the opposite sides are parallel, so that side is parallel to that side, and then this side is parallel to that side there. You're dealing with a parallelogram. And then parallelograms can be subdivided even further. They can be subdivided even further. If the four angles in a parallelogram are all right angles, you're dealing with a rectangle. So let me draw one like that. So if the four sides... So from parallelograms, this is all in the parallelogram universe, what I'm drawing right over here. This is all the parallelogram universe. So the parallelogram tells me that opposite sides are parallel. And then if we know that all four angles are 90 degrees, and we've proven in previous videos how to figure out the sum of the interior angles of any polygon, and using that same method, you can say that the sum of the interior angles of any quadrilateral is actually 360 degrees. And you see that in this special case as well, but maybe we'll prove it in a separate video. But this right over here we would call a rectangle. Parallelogram, opposite sides parallel, and we have four right angles. Now, if we have a parallelogram where we don't necessarily have four right angles, but we do have the length of all the sides being equal, then we're dealing with a rhombus. So let me draw it like that. So it's a parallelogram. This is a parallelogram. So that side is parallel to that side. This side is parallel to that side. And we also know that all four sides have equal length. So this side's length is equal to that side's length, which is equal to that side's length, which is equal to that side's length. Then we are dealing with a rhombus. So one way to view it, all rhombi are parallelograms. All rectangles are parallelograms. All parallelograms you cannot assume to be rectangles. All parallelograms you cannot assume to be rhombi. Now, something can be both a rectangle and a rhombus. So let's say that this is the universe of rectangles. So the universe of rectangles, I'll draw a little bit of a Venn diagram here, is that set of shapes. And the universe of rhombi is this set of shapes right over here. So what would it look like? Well, you would have four right angles, and they would all have the same length. So it would look like this. So it would definitely be a parallelogram. It would be a parallelogram. Four right angles. And all the sides would have the same length. And this is probably the first of the shapes that you learned, or one of the first shapes. This is clearly a square. So all squares are both rhombi, they can also be considered a rhombus, and they could also be considered a rectangle, and they could also be considered a parallelogram. But clearly, not all rectangles are squares, and not all rhombi are squares, and definitely not all parallelograms are squares. This one clearly right over here is neither a rectangle nor a rhombi nor a square. So that's an overview.

      "What I want to do in this video is give an overview of quadrilaterals, and you can imagine from this prefix, or I guess you could say the beginning of this word quad, this involves four of something, and quadrilaterals, as you can imagine, are shapes, and we're going to be talking about two-dimensional shapes, that have four sides and four vertices and four angles. So, for example, 1, 2, 3, 4. That is a quadrilateral. Although that last slide didn't look too straight. 1, 2, 3, 4. That is a quadrilateral. 1, 2, 3, 4. These are all quadrilaterals. They all have four sides, four vertices, and clearly four angles. One angle, two angles, three angles, and four angles. Here you could measure, actually let me draw this one a little bit bigger, because it's interesting. So in this one right over here, you have one angle, two angles, three angles, and then you have this really big angle right over there. If you look at the interior angles of this quadrilateral. Now quadrilaterals, as you can imagine, can be subdivided into other groups based on the properties of the quadrilaterals. And the main subdivision of quadrilaterals is between concave and convex quadrilaterals. So you have concave, and you have convex. And the way I remember concave quadrilaterals, or really concave polygons of any number of shapes, is that it looks like something has caved in. So for example, this is a concave quadrilateral. It looks like this side has been caved in. And one way to define concave quadrilaterals, so let me draw it a little bit bigger. So this right over here is a concave quadrilateral, is that it has an interior angle that is larger than 180 degrees. So for example, this interior angle right over here is larger than 180 degrees. It's an interesting proof, maybe I'll do a video, it's actually a pretty simple proof, to show that if you have a concave quadrilateral, if at least one of the interior angles has a measure larger than 180 degrees, that none of the sides can be parallel to each other. The other type of quadrilateral, you can imagine, is when all of the interior angles are less than 180 degrees. And you might say, wait, what happens at 180 degrees? Well, if this angle was 180 degrees, then these wouldn't be two different sides, it would just be one side and that would look like a triangle. But if all of the interior angles are less than 180 degrees, then you are dealing with a convex quadrilateral. So this convex quadrilateral would involve that one and that one over there. So this right over here is what a convex quadrilateral, this is what a convex quadrilateral could look like. Four points, four sides, four angles. Now within convex quadrilaterals, there are some other interesting categorizations. So now we're just going to focus on convex quadrilaterals, so that's going to be all of the space over here. So one type of convex quadrilateral is a trapezoid. And a trapezoid is a convex quadrilateral, and sometimes the definition here is a little bit, different people will use different definitions. So some people will say a trapezoid is a quadrilateral that has exactly two sides that are parallel to each other. So for example, they would say that this right over here, this right over here is a trapezoid, where this side is parallel to that side. If I give it some letters here, if I call this trapezoid ABCD, we could say that segment AB is parallel to segment DC, and because of that we know that this is a trapezoid. Now I said that the definition is a little fuzzy, because some people say you can have exactly one pair of parallel sides, but some people say at least one pair of parallel sides. So if you use the original definition, and that's the kind of thing that most people are referring to when they say a trapezoid, exactly one pair of parallel sides, it might be something like this. But if you use the broader definition of at least one pair of parallel sides, then maybe this could also be considered a trapezoid. So you have one pair of parallel sides like that, and then you have another pair of parallel sides like that. So this is a question mark where it comes to a trapezoid. A trapezoid is definitely this thing here, where you have exactly one pair of parallel sides. Depending on people's definition, this may or may not be a trapezoid. If you say it's exactly one pair of parallel sides, this is not a trapezoid because it has two pairs. If you say at least one pair of parallel sides, then this is a trapezoid. So I'll put that in a little question mark there. But there is a name for this, regardless of your definition of what a trapezoid is. If you have a quadrilateral with two pairs of parallel sides, you are then dealing with a parallelogram. So the one thing that you definitely can call this is a parallelogram. And I'll just draw it a little bit bigger. So it's a quadrilateral. If I have a quadrilateral, and if I have two pairs of parallel sides, or the opposite sides are parallel, so that side is parallel to that side, and then this side is parallel to that side there. You're dealing with a parallelogram. And then parallelograms can be subdivided even further. They can be subdivided even further. If the four angles in a parallelogram are all right angles, you're dealing with a rectangle. So let me draw one like that. So if the four sides... So from parallelograms, this is all in the parallelogram universe, what I'm drawing right over here. This is all the parallelogram universe. So the parallelogram tells me that opposite sides are parallel. And then if we know that all four angles are 90 degrees, and we've proven in previous videos how to figure out the sum of the interior angles of any polygon, and using that same method, you can say that the sum of the interior angles of any quadrilateral is actually 360 degrees. And you see that in this special case as well, but maybe we'll prove it in a separate video. But this right over here we would call a rectangle. Parallelogram, opposite sides parallel, and we have four right angles. Now, if we have a parallelogram where we don't necessarily have four right angles, but we do have the length of all the sides being equal, then we're dealing with a rhombus. So let me draw it like that. So it's a parallelogram. This is a parallelogram. So that side is parallel to that side. This side is parallel to that side. And we also know that all four sides have equal length. So this side's length is equal to that side's length, which is equal to that side's length, which is equal to that side's length. Then we are dealing with a rhombus. So one way to view it, all rhombi are parallelograms. All rectangles are parallelograms. All parallelograms you cannot assume to be rectangles. All parallelograms you cannot assume to be rhombi. Now, something can be both a rectangle and a rhombus. So let's say that this is the universe of rectangles. So the universe of rectangles, I'll draw a little bit of a Venn diagram here, is that set of shapes. And the universe of rhombi is this set of shapes right over here. So what would it look like? Well, you would have four right angles, and they would all have the same length. So it would look like this. So it would definitely be a parallelogram. It would be a parallelogram. Four right angles. And all the sides would have the same length. And this is probably the first of the shapes that you learned, or one of the first shapes. This is clearly a square. So all squares are both rhombi, they can also be considered a rhombus, and they could also be considered a rectangle, and they could also be considered a parallelogram. But clearly, not all rectangles are squares, and not all rhombi are squares, and definitely not all parallelograms are squares. This one clearly right over here is neither a rectangle nor a rhombi nor a square. So that's an overview. This gives you a little bit of taxonomy of quadrilaterals, and then in the next few videos, we can start to explore them and find their interesting properties or just do interesting problems involving them.\n",

      "Which of the following names can be used to describe the geometric shape below? So the first name in question is a quadrilateral. And a quadrilateral is literally any closed shape that has four sides. And this is definitely a closed shape that has four sides. So it is definitely a quadrilateral. Next, we have to think about whether it is a parallelogram. A parallelogram is a quadrilateral that has two pairs of parallel sides where in each pair there are opposite sides. And in this case, if you look at this side over here, it forms a 90 degree angle with this line. And this side over here also forms a 90 degree angle with this line over here. So these two sides are parallel. And then you can make the exact same argument for the other two sides. This line up here forms a 90 degree angle with this side. And so does this side forms a 90 degree angle with this line right over here. They form the same angle with this line. They're parallel. So this side is parallel to that side right over there. So this is definitely also a parallelogram. Next, we ask about a trapezoid. Now a trapezoid is interesting. Sometimes a trapezoid is defined as any quadrilateral having at least one pair of parallel sides. Sometimes it's defined as having only one pair of parallel sides. So let me write this down. Trapezoid, there's a debate here. It's not completely settled. Some people say at least one pair of parallel sides. That's one definition, one possible definition. The other one is at exactly one pair of parallel sides. And how we answer this question depends on which definition for a trapezoid we pick. Now the one that people most refer to is actually this one right over here. Exactly one pair of parallel sides. So the trapezoid that most people, when you think of a trapezoid, they think of something like this, where this side over here is parallel to that side over here, and those two are not parallel. But sometimes you'll also see this at least one pair of parallel sides. And so this would include parallelograms. It would be inclusive of parallelograms because parallelograms have two pairs of parallel sides. But I'm going to go with this definition right over here, exactly one pair of parallel sides. This has two pairs of parallel sides, so I will not call it a trapezoid. But it's always important to clarify what people are talking about because some people might say a trapezoid is at least one pair of parallel sides. And if we used that definition, then we would call it a trapezoid. So it really depends on the definition that you're using. Now let's go on to rhombus. A rhombus is a quadrilateral where four of the sides are congruent. So a rhombus will look like this. All four sides have the same length. They're not necessarily at right angles to each other. This figure over here, we have two pairs of sides that are the same length, but there's no information that tells us that this side is equal to that side or that this side is equal to that side. So we can't make the claim that this is necessarily a rhombus. We don't know for sure. If someone told us that this length is equal to that length, then things change. But for the sake of this one, we're not going to go with rhombus. A rectangle is essentially a parallelogram that has four right angles. And we already established this is a parallelogram. And it also has four right angles. One, two, three, four. So this is a rectangle. Another way to think about a rectangle is opposite sides have the same length and you have four right angles. So this is definitely a rectangle. A square, a couple of ways you could think about a square, you could view a square as a rhombus with four right angles. So if you were to kind of straighten it out a little bit, it's a rhombus so all the four sides are the same and you have four right angles. That's one way to think about a square. Or you could view it as a rectangle where all four sides are congruent. But in either case, you have to have all four sides be congruent in order to be a square. And we already established when we ruled out this being a rhombus that all four sides here are not necessarily congruent. You have two pairs of congruent sides, but we don't know whether this side and this side are congruent. So we cannot call this a square. So it's not a square, not a rhombus, not a trapezoid by the definition we picked, which is the less inclusive version where you say exactly one pair of parallel sides. It is a quadrilateral. It is a parallelogram. It is a rectangle.\n",

      "A parallelogram is a blank with two sets of parallel lines. So let's see what the options are. So one option is a quadrilateral, and a parallelogram is definitely a quadrilateral. A quadrilateral is a four-sided figure, and it is definitely a four-sided figure. A parallelogram is not always a rhombus. A rhombus is a special case of a parallelogram where not only do you have two sets of parallel lines as your sides, where two sets of parallel sides, but all of the sides are the same length in a rhombus. And a square is a special case of a rhombus where all of the angles are 90 degrees. So here all we can say is that a parallelogram is a quadrilateral, and so let's check our answer. It's always a good idea to look at hints, and so it'll kind of say the same thing that we just said, but it would say it for the particular problem that you're actually looking at. Let's do a few more of these. Susanna is on an expedition to save the universe. Sounds like a reasonable expedition to go on. For her final challenge, she has to play a game called Find the Rhombuses. A wizard tells her that she has a square, a quadrilateral, and a parallelogram, and she must identify which of the shapes are also rhombuses. Which of these shapes should she pick to save the universe? So a square is a special case of a rhombus. Just to remind ourselves, a rhombus, the opposite sides are parallel to each other. You have two sets of parallel sides. A square has two sets of parallel sides, and it has the extra condition that all of the angles are right angles. So a square is definitely going to be a rhombus. Now, all rhombuses have four sides, so all rhombuses are quadrilaterals, but not all quadrilaterals are rhombuses. You could have a quadrilateral where none of the sides are parallel to each other. So we won't click this one. Once again, a parallelogram. So all rhombuses are parallelograms. They have two sets of parallel sides, two sets of parallel line segments representing their sides, but all parallelograms are not rhombuses. So I would say that if someone gives you a square, you can say, look, a square is always going to be a rhombus. A quadrilateral isn't always going to be a rhombus, nor is a parallelogram always going to be a rhombus. We got it right.\n",

      "What is the type of this quadrilateral? Be as specific as possible with the given data. So it clearly is a quadrilateral. We have four sides here. And we see that we have two pairs of parallel sides. Or we could also say there are two pairs of congruent sides here as well. This side is parallel and congruent to this side. This side is parallel and congruent to that side. So we're dealing with a parallelogram. Let's do more of these. So here it looks like a same type of scenario that we just saw in the last one. We have two pairs of parallel and congruent sides. But all the sides aren't equal to each other. If they're all equal to each other, we'd be dealing with a rhombus. But here they're not all equal to each other. This side is congruent to the side opposite. This side is congruent to the side opposite. That's another parallelogram. Now this is interesting. We have two pairs of sides that are parallel to each other. But now all of the sides have an equal length. So this would be a parallelogram. And it is a parallelogram. But they're saying to be as specific as possible with the given data. So saying it's a rhombus would be more specific than saying it's a parallelogram. This does satisfy the constraints for being a parallelogram. But saying it's a rhombus tells us even more. Not every parallelogram is a rhombus. But every rhombus is a parallelogram. Here they have the sides are parallel to the side opposite. And all the sides are equal. Let's do a few more of these. What is the type of this quadrilateral? Be as specific as possible with the given data. So we have two pairs of sides that are parallel. Or I should say one pair. We have a pair of sides that are parallel. And then we have another pair of sides that are not. So this is a trapezoid. But then they have two choices here. They have a trapezoid and isosceles trapezoid. Now an isosceles trapezoid is a trapezoid where the two non-parallel sides have the same length. Just like an isosceles triangle, you have two sides have the same length. Well, we can see these two non-parallel sides do not have the same length. So this is not an isosceles trapezoid. If they did have the same length, then we would pick that. Because that would be more specific than just trapezoid. But this case right over here, this is just a trapezoid. Let's do one more of these. What is the type of this quadrilateral? Well, we could say it's a parallelogram because all of the sides are parallel. But if we wanted to be more specific, you could also see that all the sides are the same. So you could say it's a rhombus. But you could get even more specific than that. You notice that all of the sides are intersecting at right angles. So this is, if we wanted to be as specific as possible, this is a square. Let me check the answer. Got it right.\n",

      "Transcription for y2mate.com - Quadrilaterals kites as a geometric shape  Quadrilaterals  Geometry  Khan Academy_720pHF.mp3:\n",
      "In everyday language, we know what a kite means. It's these flimsy things that we take to the beach to fly in the wind with our families. But you could imagine mathematicians have looked at the general shape of these kites, or at least the way that they're drawn in cartoons, and said, well, that's an interesting shape in its own right. Let's also make this a mathematical term. This is a shape, like a parallelogram, or like a rhombus. It's just another type of quadrilateral. But in order for it to be used in mathematics in a useful way, we have to define it a little bit more precisely. So let's see if we can come up with a couple of interesting definitions of what a kite could be, or a couple of interesting ways to construct a kite. Well, one way that you could think about a kite is it looks like it has two pairs of sides that are congruent to each other. So for example, it looks like this side and this side need to be congruent to each other. So let's make that a constraint. And they touch each other. They have a shared common endpoint. So you have one pair of congruent sides that's adjacent to each other. They have a common endpoint. And then you have another pair of sides that are congruent to each other. And they are adjacent. They share a common endpoint. So one definition that you could make for a kite is that you have two pairs of congruent sides where the congruent sides are adjacent. And you might say, well, what's the other alternative? If the congruent sides aren't adjacent, what else could they be? Well, the congruent sides could be opposite each other. And what happens if you were to do that? So if these two sides are congruent, but they didn't have a common endpoint and we're still dealing with a quadrilateral, what would it look like? Well, you would have one congruent side here. And that would be congruent to this side right over here. And then you would have a congruent side right over here that is congruent to this side. This would be a situation where you have two pairs of congruent sides. But they're not adjacent. They don't have any common endpoints with each other. Each side in the congruent side pair, they are opposite to each other. So here, once again, we get a quadrilateral. We still get four sides. A kite is a quadrilateral. This is a quadrilateral. But this isn't a kite. This right over here is a parallelogram. And we've seen that multiple times before. But kites can also be constructed in other interesting ways. You might see that it looks right here that these two diagonals of this kite are perpendicular. And that, indeed, and I'm not going to prove it here, is a property of a kite. This right over here, these two lines, these two diagonals, intersect at a 90 degree angle. The other thing we know about kites is that one of these lines is bisecting the other of the two. So you could actually construct a kite that way. You could start with a line. And then you could construct a perpendicular bisector of that line, another segment that bisects it at a 90 degree angle. So here, there you go. So that bisects it. So that means that this segment is equal to this segment. We split it in two. And then if you connect the endpoints of the segments, you should get a kite. And you will, indeed, get a kite. So it would look something like this. And once again, this segment is congruent to this adjacent segment. And this segment is congruent to this adjacent segment. But what would happen if these two diagonals are both perpendicular bisectors of each other? So what would happen in this scenario, where let me draw one segment. And then I'm going to make another segment. But they're going to be perpendicular bisectors of each other. So let's do that. So now, they're both perpendicular bisectors of each other. So this segment is equal to this segment. And this segment is equal to this segment. Well, now, once again, you still have a kite. But now, you're also satisfying the constraint for another type of quadrilateral that we've seen. So now, you're satisfying the constraint. All your sides are equal. All of your sides are parallel. You are now dealing with a rhombus, which is also a special type of parallelogram. And then if you were to go even further, where these two diagonals have the exact same length, and they're both perpendicular bisectors of each other. So you have they're both the exact same length. I'll try to draw it as cleanly as I can. So they're both the exact same length. And they're both perpendicular bisectors of each other. So each of these halves would be the same length as well. Then you have a subset of, I guess I could say, rhombi. And you get to a square. So one way of thinking about it is any square is also a rhombus, and any rhombus is also going to satisfy your constraints for being a kite. But there's a bunch of kites that don't satisfy your constraints of being a rhombus or a square. A kite is just two pairs of congruent sides that are adjacent to each other. And they're usually pretty easy to spot out because they look like kites.\n",

      "So we're told that Lynette can wash 95 cars in five days. How many cars can Lynette wash in 11 days? So like always, pause this video and see if you can figure this out. So the way that I would like to tackle it is, given the information they gave us, 95 cars in five days, can we figure out how many cars she can wash per day? How many cars in one day? And then we could just multiply that by 11 to figure out how many she could wash in 11 days. So there's 95 cars in five days. And so instead of five, if we were to say one day, one day, well, to go from five days to one day, we divide by five. So the number of cars she can do in one day, that would be that divided by five. In either case, we would divide by five. And what's 95 divided by five? You might recognize that, well, look, five times 20 is equal to 100. So five times 19 is 95. So you might recognize that's 19 cars in one day. Or if that math I just did seems a little bit too fast, you could just take five into 95. Five goes into nine one time. One times five is five. Subtract. Nine minus five is four. Bring down that five. Five goes into 45 nine times. Nine times five is 45. And it goes in perfectly. There's no remainder. So all I did is I divided both of these numbers by five to figure out how many she can wash per day. So she can wash 19 cars in one day. 19 cars per day. And so if I want to figure out how many she can wash in 11 days, so in 11 days, well, now I am just multiplying by 11. So if I multiply 19 times 11, what am I going to get? Well, if you're good at the mental mathematics, you might recognize 19 times 10 would be 190. And then you would have one more 19. So that would be 209 cars. Or you could just multiply 19 times 11. One times 19 is 19. And then one times 19 is 19. Add them together. You get 209. So she can wash 209 cars in 11 days. Let's do another example. Here we are told at the market, eight batteries cost $10. How much do six batteries cost? Once again, pause this video and try to figure it out. Well, I'm gonna do the same technique. If eight batteries cost $10, let's figure out how much one battery costs. So one battery costs what? Figure that out. Well, it's going to be 1 8th. If to go from eight to one, I divide by eight. So what happens when I divide 10 by eight? That's gonna be my per battery cost. So 10 divided by eight is the same thing as five over four, which is the same thing as 1 1 4th, which is the same thing. If we're talking in terms of money, it might be more useful to write it like 1 25 hundredths. Or one battery costs $1.25. And so when they're saying six batteries, how much do six batteries cost? Well, if we're going to six batteries cost, we're multiplying the number of batteries times six now. So what's $1.25 times six? So it's gonna be $6 plus another $1.50, because six times 25 is 150. So it's gonna be $7.50. And just to make sure the math I just did was right, let's multiply $1.25 times six. Six times five is 30. Six times two is 12, plus three is 15. Six times one is six, plus one is seven. And we have a total of two digits behind the decimal. So there you have it. You have $7.50. Now there's other ways that you could tackle this. You could say that, hey, this is six batteries is gonna cost 6 8ths as much as eight batteries. But that's a little bit confusing, at least for my brain. I like to go just down to the unit cost, you could say, the cost per battery, and then multiply it by six. It gives me more comfort in understanding what I'm doing.\n",

      "Let's do some example questions dealing with ratios. So we're told the table shows the number of people waiting in line for different rides at an amusement park. So 15 people are waiting in line for the roller coaster, four people for the slingshot, 12 people waiting in line for the bumper cars, and 11 people in line for the roundup. What is the ratio of people waiting in line for the roundup to the people waiting in line for the slingshot? Pause this video and see if you can figure it out. So we wanna know the ratio of the people waiting in line for the roundup, this is the roundup right over here, to the number of people waiting in line for the slingshot. So there's 11 people waiting in line for the roundup, and there are four people waiting in line for the slingshot. So the ratio is 11 to four, or for every 11 people in line for the roundup, there are four people waiting in line for the slingshot. Let's do another example. Katie loves to read. In the last few months, she has read three graphic novels, two mysteries, four science fiction novels, and 21 comic books. What is the ratio of sci-fi novels to comic books? So once again, pause this video and try to work it out on your own. All right, so we wanna know the ratio of sci-fi novels. So she has four sci-fi novels, the ratio of that to comic books. She has 21 comic books. So the ratio is for every four sci-fi novels, she has 21 comic books. Don't let me do that, that other color. She has 21 comic books. So the ratio is four to 21, the ratio of sci-fi novels to comic books. Four sci-fi novels for every 21 comic books. Let's do one more example. This is strangely fun. What is the ratio of apples to bananas? Pause this video and try to figure it out. So let's see, there are one, two, three apples. So for every three apples, how many bananas are there? Well, there's one, two, three, four bananas. So the ratio of apples to, the ratio of apples to bananas is three apples for every four bananas. Order matters. If they said the ratio of bananas to apples, then this would be four to three. But they say apples to bananas, three to four. Three apples for every four bananas.\n",

What is the ratio of people waiting in line for the roundup to the people waiting in line for the slingshot? Pause this video and see if you can figure it out. So we wanna know the ratio of the people waiting in line for the roundup, this is the roundup right over here, to the number of people waiting in line for the slingshot. So there's 11 people waiting in line for the roundup, and there are four people waiting in line for the slingshot. So the ratio is 11 to four, or for every 11 people in line for the roundup, there are four people waiting in line for the slingshot. Let's do another example. Katie loves to read. In the last few months, she has read three graphic novels, two mysteries, four science fiction novels, and 21 comic books. What is the ratio of sci-fi novels to comic books? So once again, pause this video and try to work it out on your own. All right, so we wanna know the ratio of sci-fi novels. So she has four sci-fi novels, the ratio of that to comic books. She has 21 comic books. So the ratio is for every four sci-fi novels, she has 21 comic books. Don't let me do that, that other color. She has 21 comic books. So the ratio is four to 21, the ratio of sci-fi novels to comic books. Four sci-fi novels for every 21 comic books. Let's do one more example. This is strangely fun. What is the ratio of apples to bananas? Pause this video and try to figure it out. So let's see, there are one, two, three apples. So for every three apples, how many bananas are there? Well, there's one, two, three, four bananas. So the ratio of apples to, the ratio of apples to bananas is three apples for every four bananas. Order matters. If they said the ratio of bananas to apples, then this would be four to three. But they say apples to bananas, three to four. Three apples for every four bananas.\n",

      "What we're going to do in this video is tackle some word problems involving ratios. So here we're told that Yoda soda is the intergalactic party drink that will have all of your friends saying, mm, good this is. You are throwing a party and you need five liters of Yoda soda for every 12 guests. If you have 36 guests, how many liters of Yoda soda do you need? So pause this video and try to figure it out on your own. Well, they tell us the ratio of liters of soda to number of guests. So you need five, it's five liters for every 12 guests is the ratio. But we want to have 36 guests. So if the ratio is five liters of soda for every 12 guests, but we're in a situation where we have 36 guests, so this is three times as many guests, we're gonna need three times as many liters of soda. So three times five is 15. Five to 12, five liters for 12 guests, or for five liters for every 12 guests is the same thing as 15 liters for every 36 guests. So to answer that question, how many liters do you need? You need 15 liters. Let's do another one of these. Here we just have a picture of a bunch of fish in a tank. And it says there are eight big fish for every blank small fish. And then it says there are four big fish for every blank small fish. So pause this video again and see if you can work through this. All right, so let's just count the big fish first. So there's one, two, three, oh, let me see, count this way. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. So in this tank, there actually are eight big fish. And so let's see how many small fish there are. There's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10 small fish. So in the tank, for every eight big fish, which you see in red, there are 10 small fish. But here it says there are four big fish for every blank small fish. So what would that be? Well, one way to think about it is we have half as many fish, or half as many big fish, so we divide it by two. So we're gonna have half as many small fish. So we're gonna divide by two. So for every four big fish, there are five small fish. And one way to think about it, you could divide the fish evenly into two groups right over here. So let's see, if we can capture, so if you could have, this is, so if I divide it like that, here I have one, two, three, four big fish, and one, two, three, four, five small fish. Then in this group, I have one, two, three, four big fish, and one, two, three, four, five small fish. So every four big fish, there are five small fish. These are equivalent ratios. Let's keep going. So here, we're told an ice cream shop uses the following ingredients to make one sundae. So they use two scoops of ice cream, four spoonfuls of sprinkles, two tablespoons of whipped cream. How many sundaes did the shop make if they used 32 spoonfuls of sprinkles? So pause the video and try to think about it. So there's a couple of ways to think about it. Here, it says, let's see, we're talking about sprinkles, so that's what's relevant here. Four spoonfuls for every one sundae. So we could say that they're, so the ratio of spoonfuls to sundaes is four to one. Four spoonfuls, spoonfuls of sprinkles. Let me write it this way. Let me write sprinkles, sprinkles, how many spoonfuls, how many spoonfuls per one sundae? But here, we're talking about using 32 spoonfuls of sprinkles. So that is eight times as many. So you're gonna be able to use, create eight times as many sundaes. So you're gonna have 32 spoonfuls of sprinkles for every eight sundaes. So how many sundaes did the shop make? Well, they made eight. Let's do one last example. At a dog park, there are 10 black dogs, five brown dogs, two white dogs, and 12 multicolored dogs. For every one brown dog, there are two blank dogs. Pause the video and figure out what goes in this blank. All right, so let's see. There's five brown dogs for every 10 black dogs, five brown dogs for every two white dogs, and five brown dogs for every 12 multicolored dogs. But here, you're saying that for every one brown dog, there are two blank dogs. So what type of dog is their ratio so for every brown dog, there's twice as many of that type of dog? Well, here, we see for every five brown dogs, there are 10 black dogs. So one way to think about it, the number of black dogs is always gonna be twice the number of brown dogs. So for every one brown dog, there would be two, two black, two black dogs. One way to think about it, the ratio between brown dogs and black dogs, and it's kind of counterintuitive. I used the wrong colors here. I should use brown and black. So let me do that. So the ratio of brown to black is five brown dogs for every 10 black dogs. Or if you divide both of these numbers by five, you would get one, one brown dog for every two, for every two black dogs. And that's exactly what this statement is saying.\n",

      "We're told that the double number line shows that five pounds of avocados cost $9. And so what is going on here with this double number line? This shows how as we increase the number of avocados, how the cost increases. So for example, when we have zero pounds of avocados, it costs us $0. When we have five pounds of avocados, it costs us $9. And so if you look at any point over here, let's say you look right over here, this would be, let's see, this is one, right? This is one, two, three, four, five. If you look at one, this point on the cost number line would tell you how much one pound of avocado would cost. Two pounds of avocados, how much would that cost? You would look at this second number line right over there. So they ask us, based on the ratio shown in the double number line, what is the cost for one pound of avocados? So pause the video and think about it. Remember, one pound of avocados on this top number line, we look at the second number line, the cost would be right over here. What is this going to be? Well, we could just set it up as a ratio. The ratio of pounds of avocados to cost is going to be, let me do this in some colors. So if I have five pounds of avocados, it is going to cost me nine dollars. So the ratio of pounds to dollars is five to nine. So if I were to have one pound of avocado, one pound of avocado, I have divided by five to get one pound of avocado. I would have to do the same thing for the cost. So if I divide nine by five, this is going to be 9 5ths dollars of, 9 5ths dollars would be the cost of one pound. Well, 9 5ths isn't always the most natural way to write money. So you could view this 9 5ths is equal to one and 4 5ths, which is equal to one and eight tenths, which is equal to 1.8, or you could say this is one dollar and 80 cents. So if you were to go on to this double number line, the cost of one pound of avocado, this point right over here would be one dollar and 80 cents. She said two pounds of avocados, well now you would double it. So this would be three dollars and 60 cents. And you would go on and on and on all the way until you got to nine dollars here. Let's do another example. So here we are told the double number line shows how many model trains Irene can build in a week. So we can see in zero weeks she can't build any trains, but in one week she can build nine trains. And they ask us which table represents the rate of Irene building model trains. So pause this video and see if you can figure it out. So once again, every week she can build nine trains. So one way to think about it is the ratio of weeks to trains would be one to nine. So let's see, if I look at this table, I just want to see where the ratio between weeks to trains stays at one to nine. So five to 45, that is still one to nine. To go from one to five, I've multiplied by five. And then to go to nine to 45, I've also multiplied by five. So this one checks out. Now, and another way to think about it is 45 is nine times five. So nine times. And that might be an easier way to think about it. Over here, 12 to 108, well that's once again, 12 times nine is 108. And then 26 to 234, let's see, 26 times 10 would be 260 minus 26, yeah, it would be 234. So this is nine times. So in all of these cases, the ratio of trains or the ratio of weeks to trains is one to nine. So this one is looking good. So I'll just circle that in. But let's just make sure that this one doesn't work. Well, over here, the ratio of weeks to trains is nine to one, not one to nine. The train should be nine times the weeks, while here, the weeks is nine times the trains. So just looking at that first one, we know that this is not going to work out. Let's do one last example. The double number line shows how many snowballs Jacob and his friends can make in one minute. In no minutes, they can make zero snowballs. In one minute, they can make 12. Complete the table to show the same information as the double number line. So once again, pause this video and see if you can work this out. Well, we can think about it as a ratio. The ratio of minutes to snowballs is one to 12. So minutes to snowballs is one to 12. Or another way to think about it is the snowballs is going to be 12 times the minutes. And so over here, if I have 12 snowballs, well, we already know that's going to be one minute. If I have 48 snowballs, well, let's just think about it. To go from 12 to 48, you have to multiply by four. So you have four times as many snowballs. It's going to take you four times as many minutes. And then if you go to five, well, to go from one to five, you multiply by five. So you're going to have five times as many snowballs than you would be able to make in one minute. So five times 12 is 60, and we're done. It could be one to 12, four to 48, five to 60. For every five minutes, you can make 60 snowballs. Or they make 60 snowballs.\n",

      "We're told to complete the ratio table to convert the units of measure from hours to weeks or weeks to hours. So we see here, they've told us already that there's 168 hours for every one week. One way to think about it is the ratio of hours for every week is 168 to one. And then they calculate, well, if we have 1,176 hours, how many weeks is that going to be? So pause this video and see if you can figure it out. Well, let's see, to go from 168 to 1,176, what do we have to multiply by? So let's see, that looks like we might be multiplying by seven. Let me try that out. So 168 times seven is equal to eight times seven is 56. Six times seven is 42 plus five is 47. And then one times seven plus four is indeed 1,176. So we multiplied by seven, we multiply the number of hours by seven, so that means we're gonna have seven times as many weeks. So one times seven is just, that is seven weeks. Now, what about a situation where we have three weeks? How many hours is that going to be? Well, we are multiplying our weeks by three, so we would want to multiply our hours. We would want to multiply our hours times three. So 168 times three, eight times three is 24. Six times three is 18 plus two is 20. And then one times three is three plus two is five. So that would be 504 hours. Let's do another example. So here they tell us the double number lines show the ratio of yards to miles. So the ratio of yards to miles, it looks like we have 3,520 yards for every two miles, for every two miles. And you see that on this double number line right over here. Then they say how many yards are in five miles? So why don't you pause this video and try to figure it out? Well, the way my brain wants to do it is, well, let's just think about how many yards are in each mile. So if the ratio is 3,520 to two, well, how could I rewrite this ratio so it is how many yards for every one mile? So to go from two to one, I am dividing by two. So I would want to divide this by two as well. So two goes into 3,520, let's see. Two goes into three one time. One times two is two, you subtract. You bring down the five. Two goes into 15 seven times. Seven times two is 14, subtract. We have one, bring down that two. Two goes into 12 six times. Six times two is 12. And we subtract, no remainder. But then we're gonna have one more zero here because we bring down that zero. We say two goes into zero zero times. Zero times two is zero, and we have no remainder. And so this is 1,760. So we could put that here on our double number lines. So if we have one mile, that is 1,760 yards. Now they're asking about five miles. So three, four, five. So we have five miles. What is the number of yards? Well, if you multiply by five here, you're also going to multiply by five right over there. So what's 1,760 times five? Well, let's just figure it out. 1,760 times five. Five times zero is zero. Five times six is 30. Regroup that three because it's really three hundreds. Five times seven is 35 plus three is 38. Five times one is five plus three is eight. So there you go, 8,800 yards. 8,800 yards. Let's do a few more examples. Here we're told there are 914.4 millimeters in a yard. There are three feet in a yard. How many millimeters are in a foot? Okay, so one way to think about it, you could say there's 914.4 millimeters per yard or you could say 914.4 millimeters per three feet since three feet and a yard is the same thing. So if you want to know per foot, you would just divide both of these by three. So let's do that. And I'll just do it in a different color here. Three goes into 914.4. Three goes into nine three times. Three times three is nine. Subtract, we get a zero. Bring down the one. Three goes into one zero times. Zero times three is zero. Subtract, you get a one. Bring down that four. Three goes into 14 four times. We're gonna have this decimal right over here. Four times three is 12. You subtract and then so you get a two. Bring down this four. You get a 24 and lucky for us, three goes perfectly into 24 eight times. Eight times three is 24, 24. You subtract and we have no remainder. So we have 304.8 millimeters for every foot. Let's do one last example. Yuki bought a pound of confetti for $12. What is the price in dollars per ounce of confetti? There is 16 ounces in one pound. So pause this video and see if you can figure it out. So let's just write this out in words. So it's $12 per pound of confetti. So you could view this as $12 per 16 ounces. 16 ounces of confetti. And so if we want it per ounce, so you could view this as a 12 to 16 ratio, but we wanna say something to one ratio. So if you say per one ounce, well, we're dividing by 16 there. So we would wanna divide by 16 as well. So this is going to be 12 divided by 16. So 12 divided by, well, let me write it over here. So 12 divided by 16 is the same thing as 3 4ths. Just divide both of them by four. And so this is 0.75, or 75 cents per ounce, or 75 hundredths of a dollar per ounce. So 0.75, and we're done.\n",

      "Let's think about another scenario involving ratios. In this case, let's think about the ratio of the number of apples to the number of oranges. Let's take the number of apples to the number of fruit that we have over here. And I encourage you to pause the video and think about that on your own. Well, how many total apples do we have? We have 2, 4, 6, 8 apples. So we're going to have 8 apples. And then how much total fruit do we have? Well, we have 8 apples and we have 3, 6, 9, 12 oranges. So our total fruit is 8 plus 12. We have 20 pieces of fruit. So this ratio is going to be 8 to 20. Or if we want to write this in a more reduced form, we can divide both of these by 4. 4 is their greatest common divisor. And so this is the same thing as a ratio. 8 divided by 4 is 2. And 20 divided by 4 is 5. So 2 to 5. Now, does this make sense? Well, if we divide everything into groups of 4, or if we divide into 4 groups, I should say. So 1 group, 2 groups, 3 groups, and 4 groups. And that's the largest number of groups that we can divide these into so that we don't have to cut up the apples or the oranges. We see that in each group, for every 2 apples, we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 pieces of fruit. For every 2 apples, we have 5 pieces of fruit. And this is actually a good opportunity for us to introduce another way of representing ratios. And that's using fraction notation. So we could also represent this ratio as 2 over 5. As the fraction 2 over 5. Whenever we put it in the fraction, it's very important to recognize what this represents. This is telling us the fraction of fruit that are apples. So we could say 2 fifths of the number of fruit is equal to the number of apples. Let me just say 2 fifths of fruit, if we're just speaking in more typical terms. 2 fifths of fruit are apples. So once again, this is introducing another way of representing ratios. We could say that the ratio of apples to fruit, once again, it could be 2 to 5 like that. It could be 2, instead of putting this little colon there, we could literally write out the word 2, 2 to 5. Or we could say it's 2 fifths, the fraction 2 fifths, which would sometimes be read as 2 to 5. When it's written this way, you could also read that as a ratio depending on the context. In a sentence like this, I would read this 2 fifths of the fruit are apples.\n",

      "So right over here, we have the recipe for super cake, which you want to make for your guests that are coming over for dinner tonight. But this recipe right over here, this is for 32 people. This would serve 32 folks. But you only have 16 guests coming over. So if you only have 16 guests coming over, what should be your ingredients here? How much of each of these ingredients should you have? And I encourage you to pause the video and think about it. All right, so right now we're gonna think about, well, we're gonna have a slightly smaller super cake. Smaller super, super cake. And you might have reasoned that, look, if we're going to have half as many guests, then each of the ingredients, we should just have half as much. And you would be right. Instead of eight eggs for our smaller super cake, you could have four eggs. Instead of six cups of flour in our smaller super cake, you could have three cups of flour. Instead of six cups of sugar, you could have three cups of sugar. I'm just taking half of each of these numbers. Instead of two cups of butter, you could have one cup of butter. Instead of six teaspoons of baking soda, you could have three teaspoons of baking soda. And last but not least, instead of two cups of water, you could have one cup of water. Now, this will work, and this is actually how you should adjust recipes. But there's something interesting about what's similar about these two recipes, the recipe for the main super cake that feeds 32 people and the recipe for the smaller super cake. And that's the notion of ratios, the ratios between ingredients or the ratio of how much of an ingredient you need for a given guest. So for example, you can see here that for every eight eggs, you have six cups of flour. So let me write this down. So for every eight eggs, we have six cups of flour. We have six cups of flour, which can be expressed as a ratio of the ratio of eggs to flour is eight to six, which is once again interpreted as for every eight eggs, I have six cups of flour. If I said for every six cups of flour, I have eight eggs, I would have written six to eight. So the order here matters. But here I'm saying the ratio of eggs to flour, of eggs to cups of flour, is eight to six. For every eight eggs, I have six cups of flour. Well, what about for the smaller cake? Well here, for every four eggs, for every four eggs, we have three cups of flour. We have three cups of flour. So what would this ratio be? Well, for every four eggs, we have three cups of flour. Cups of flour. So the ratio of eggs to flour is four to three. Now it turns out that these are the exact same ratio. If you have eight eggs for every six cups of flour, or for every eight eggs, you have six cups of flour, that's the same thing as for every four eggs, you have three cups of flour. What you're just doing is taking each of these numbers and you are dividing it by two. So you could say the ratio in either case, the ratio of eggs to flour, let me write this down, the ratio of eggs to cups of flour, let me write it, to cups of flour, cups of flour, in either case is four eggs for every three cups of flour. Four eggs for every three cups of flour. This is going to be true for either recipe. You have the same ratio. If you have eight eggs here, so for every four eggs, you have three cups of flour, well, that means you're going to have six cups of flour. And so this is why ratios are helpful. This recipe has a different number of eggs, a different number of cups of flour, a different number of cups of sugar, but the ratios between the ingredients are the same, and so you will be able to have a cake that tastes the same that essentially is the same cake, but just is a different size.\n",

      "We're told Kenzie makes quilts with some blue squares and some green squares. The ratio of blue squares to green squares is shown in the diagram. The table shows the number of blue squares and the number of green squares that Kenzie will make on two of her quilts. All right, this is the table they're talking about. Based on the ratio, complete the missing values in the table. So why don't you pause this video and see if you can figure it out. Well, first let's think about the ratio of blue to green squares. So for every three blue squares, let me do that same or similar color, for every three blue squares, we are going to have one, two, three, four, five green squares. So the ratio of blue to green is three to five. And so in quilt A, she has 21 blue squares. So she has 21 blue squares. How many green squares would she have? Well, to go from three to 21, you have to multiply by seven. And so you would take five and then multiply that by seven. So you'd multiply five times seven to get to 35. As long as you multiply both of these by the same number or divide them by the same number, you're going to get an equivalent ratio. So 21 to 35 is the same thing as three to five. Now we have a situation in quilt B. They've given us the number of green squares. So that's 20. Well, how do we get 20 from five? Well, we would multiply by four. So if you multiply the number of green squares by four, then you would do the same thing for the number of blue squares. Three times four, three times four is going to be equal to 12. 12 blue squares for every 20 green squares is the same ratio as three blue squares for every five green squares. Let's do another example. Here we are told the following diagram describes the number of cups of blue and red paint in a mixture. What is the ratio of blue paint to red paint in the mixture? So try to work it out. All right, so let's just see. We have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 10 cups of blue paint for every one, two, three, four, five, six cups of red paint. So this would be a legitimate ratio, a ratio of 10 cups of blue paint for every six cups of red paint. But this isn't in, I guess you could say, lowest terms or most simplified terms because we can actually divide both of these numbers by two. So if you divide 10 by two, you get five, blue color, and if you divide six by two, you get three. So one way to think about it is for every five blue squares, you have three red squares in this diagram, in this tape diagram that's sometimes called, or you could say for every five cups of blue paint, you have three cups of red paint in our mixture, and you could even see that here. So three cups of red paint, and one, two, three, four, five, and five cups of blue paint, and you see that again right over here. Let's do another example. Here we're told Luna and Ginny each cast magic spells. The ratio of spells Luna casts to spells Ginny casts is represented in this tape diagram. All right, based on the ratio, what is the number of spells Ginny casts when Luna casts 20 spells? Pause this video, see if you can work it out. All right, so let's just see the ratio here. For every one, two, three, four spells that Luna casts, Ginny casts one, two, three, four, five spells, so the ratio is four to five. But if Luna casts 20 spells, so if Luna casts 20 spells, well, to go from four to 20, we had to multiply by five, and so we would do the same thing with the number of spells Ginny casts. You'd multiply that by five, so it's 25. So four Luna spells for every five Ginny spells is the same thing as 20 Luna spells for every 25 Ginny spells. And so how many spells does Ginny cast when Luna casts 20 spells? She casts 25, and we're done.\n",

And we see there's a dot for each camper's bag and it tells us that there's one bag that has this much trail mix, one bag that has this much trail mix, two bags that have this much trail mix. If the total amount of trail mix in all of the bags were redistributed so that each bag contained an equal amount of trail mix, how much trail mix would be in each bag? All measurements are rounded to the nearest eighth of an ounce. So right now, the bags, there's different amounts depending on which bag you look at. But they want us to redistribute it. So what we really wanna do is think about, let's take all of the trail mix in the four bags together and then divide it by four so that they all have an even amount. So let's just think about how much trail mix we have in these four bags together. So we have this bag right over here and it has this amount. And let's see, it says rounded to the nearest eighth of an ounce. And are these eighths? Let's see, this is one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, yep. So between two and three is divided into eight sections. So each of these hash marks are an eighth. So this is two and one eighth, two and two eighths. So this is two and two eighths. Now, two eighths is the same thing as one fourth. You can divide two by two and eight by two and you would get one fourth. So two and two eighths is the same thing as two and a fourth. And now you have this bag right over here. And how much is in this bag? Well, let's see. That is one eighth, two eighths, three eighths, four eighths, five eighths, six eighths. So that's going to be two and six eighths. Now, six eighths, six and eight are both divisible by two. So if you divide them both by two, that's the same thing as three fourths. So that's the same thing as two and three fourths. Two and three fourths. And now you have two dots right over at this point over here. So there's two dots that have this many ounces of trail mix. Well, how many ounces is this? Three and one eighth, two eighths, three eighths, four eighths. So that's three and four eighths. Well, four eighths is the same thing. They're both divisible by four. Four divided by four is one. Eight divided by four is two. This is the same thing as three and one half. Three and one half. And you see that this dot right over here, it is halfway between three and four. And so let's think about, let's list the amount of ounces in each of the bags. So you have two and one fourth ounces. That's one of the bags. You have another bag that's two and three fourths ounces. And then you have two bags. Remember, there's two bags here. That's what the dot plot does for us. We have two bags here that are three and a half ounces. So three and a half and three and a half. Now, let me make sure that doesn't look like an exponent to you. Three and a half. Now, what was our strategy? What we wanted to do is redistribute all of the trail mix so that we have the same amount in each bag. So one way that you could imagine this is imagine everyone pouring their trail mix into a big pile and then dividing that pile into four and then putting exactly one fourth of the total in each bag. Then you would redistribute it so that you have the same amount in each bag. So let's add it all together. Let's create our pile. Let's add two and one fourth plus two and three fourths plus three and a half plus three and a half. Well, what is, what is, let's see, two, two plus two is four. One fourth plus three fourths is going to be four fourths. So this right over here is going to be equal to, this is going to be equal to five. Another way to think about it, you could rewrite these. You could say two and one fourth, two is the same thing as eight fourths. So this would be nine fourths plus, plus, you could plus, let's see, four times two is eight plus three is 11 plus 11 fourths and then, then you would have three and a half. Three and a half plus three and a half, you might say three plus three is six, half plus half is one, so it's going to be seven. But if you wanted to write it like this, you could write, well, let's see, three and a half, that's two times three is six plus one is seven plus seven halves plus seven halves. So these are sometimes called improper fractions, although some people disagree with calling them improper fractions. These are just fractions where the numerator is greater than the denominator. But anyway, let's add all of this up. So nine elevenths, nine, let me do this in a color I haven't used yet. So nine, sorry, not nine elevenths, nine fourths plus 11 fourths is going to be equal to what? This part is going to be equal to 20 fourths, which is the same thing as five. 20 divided by four is five. Or you could say 20 fourths is going to be five wholes. And then seven halves plus seven halves, that's going to be 14 halves plus 14 halves, that's this part right over here. 14 halves is the same thing as seven. Five plus seven. So in total, you have 12 ounces. And once again, I just did this as another way to do it, but you could have just said, look, two plus two is four. One fourth plus three fourths is another whole. So four plus one is five. And then three and a half plus three and a half, three plus three is six. Half plus half is one. Six plus one is seven. So in total, you have 12 ounces. Now that's if you combine everything together, but now we want to redistribute it into the four bags. So we want to divide it equally into four bags. So you just take your 12 ounces, let me do this in a new color. You just want to take your 12 ounces, and divide it by four. Divide it into four equal groups, and then you're gonna get three ounces per bag. So that's our answer. How much trail mix would be in each bag? Three ounces. And we are done.\n",

      "We're told this table shows equivalent ratios to 24 to 40, fill in the missing values. And they write the ratio 24 to 40 right over here. 24, 24, when the numerator is 24, the denominator is 40. So in that way you could think of 24 over 40. But then they want us to write equivalent ratios where we have to fill in different blanks over here in the denominator and here in the numerator. And there's a bunch of ways that we could actually tackle this, but maybe the easiest is to start with the ratio that they gave us, where they gave us both the numerator and the denominator, and then move from there. So for example, if we look at this one right over here, the numerator is 12, it is half of the 24. So the denominator is also going to be half of the denominator here, it's going to be half of 40. So we could stick a 20 right over there. And then we could go up here. If you compare the three to the 12, to go from 12 to three you have to divide by four. So in the numerator you're dividing by four, so in the denominator you also want to divide by four. So 20 divided by four is five. And then we have one more to fill in, this numerator right over here. And we see from the denominator, we doubled the denominator. We went from 40 to 80, so we would double the numerator as well, and so you would get 48. And what we just did here is we wrote four equivalent ratios the ratio three to five, or three over five, is the same thing as 12 to 20, is the same thing as 24 to 40, is the same thing as 48 to 80. Let's make sure we got the right answer. Let's do a couple more of these. The following table shows equivalent fractions to 27 75ths. So then they wrote all of the different equivalent fractions. This table shows ratios equivalent to 18 55ths. Fair enough. All right, so these are all equivalent to 27 75ths. These are all equivalent to 18 55ths, so all of these. Which fraction is greater, 27 75ths or 18 55ths? So this is an interesting thing. What we wanna do, because you look at these two things, and you're like, well, I don't know, their denominators are different, how do I compare them? And the best way that I can think of comparing them is look at a point where you're getting an equivalent fraction, and either the numerators are going to be the same, or the denominators are going to be the same. So let's see if there's any situation here. So you have the situation where we see 27 over 75 is 54 over 150, and over here we see that 18 55ths is 54, and this 54 jumped out at me because it's the same numerator, over 165. And that makes the comparison much easier. What is smaller, 54 over 150, or 54 over 165? Well, if you have the same numerator, having a larger denominator will make the number smaller. So 54 over 165 is smaller than 54 over 150, which tells us that 18 over 55 is smaller than 27 over 75. So let's see, which of these? So this is saying that 27 over 75 is greater than 18 55ths, and that is absolutely right. Let's do one more of these. Lunara's friends are running a race. Each of them runs at a constant speed, starting at time zero. Which of these tables might show the distances one of Lunara's friends traveled over time? So they're running a race. Each of them runs at a constant speed, starting at time zero. So table one, so distance run in meters. So they're running at a constant speed. So really the ratio between distance and time should be constant throughout all of these possible tables. So here you have a ratio of three to two. If you triple the distance, we're tripling the time. If you multiply the distance by five, we're multiplying the time by five. So table one seems completely reasonable. Let's keep going. Table two, 11 to four, and then 12 to five. Here it's just incrementing by one, but the ratios are not the same. 11 to four is not the same thing as 12 to five. So we're not going to be able to, this is not a legitimate, this right over here is not a legitimate table. Table three, so one to one, then when you double the distance, we double the time. When you triple the distance, when you tripled the distance from one, you didn't triple the time. So table three doesn't seem to make sense either. Table four, so 14 to 10. So that's the same thing as, let's see, that's the same ratio as if we were to divide by two as seven to five ratio. If we divide both of these by three, this is also a seven to five ratio. And if you divide both of these by seven, this is also a seven to five ratio. So table four seems like a completely reasonable, a completely reasonable scenario. And we can check our answer, and it is.\n",

      "Show 109% by shading. So just as a bit of a review, 109%, if we were to write it out, would literally be 109% per cent, which is the same thing as 109 per, and I could write cent again, but that's getting old, cent means 100. So it literally means 109 per 100. If you had 100 per 100, you're dealing with a whole, but now we have more than a whole. We have 109 per 100. We can actually write this as a ratio or as a fraction. This is the same thing as 109 per 100. It's the same thing as 109 over 100. So let's shade that in. So we have a whole here, so we could consider this square a whole. In the last video we counted, this is a 10 by 10 square. It is cut up into 100 pieces. So if we want 109 of those 100 pieces, what are we talking about? Well, that means we're going to shade in all of the 100 right over here. Let me do that in a new color. So we'll shade in all of this right here. If you just shaded that in, that would be 100%. That would be 100 over 100, or 100 per 100, or 100%. I think you're getting the meaning of all of this here. I just don't want you to just memorize the steps. This really just means 100 out of 100, or a whole. And you can see that this is the whole square. That's 100 out of 100 right there. The question is saying, show us 109% by shading. So we already did 100 per 100, but we need to do another 9. So let's shade in another 9. So now we have a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. So this piece right here, you could almost view that as 9%. That is 9% of an entire square. This is 100% of an entire square. If you consider this whole thing plus this blue area right over here, you're talking about 109% of one whole square. Hopefully that made sense.\n",

      "Susan has 96 minutes to complete a test at school. The test begins at 1.59 PM, and Susan has volleyball practice at 4 PM. How much time will Susan have between the end of the test and the beginning of volleyball practice? Let's think about this a little bit. So the test begins at 1.59. So it's a very strange time to begin a test, but let's just go with that. So let me draw a little timeline here. So let's say that this is 2 o'clock. So this is 2 o'clock PM. Then we're going to have 3 o'clock PM. Then we're going to have 4 o'clock PM, which is also when volleyball practice begins. So this is volleyball practice. It's going to start then and then go on from 4 PM. And then the test begins at 1.59. So let me continue the number line. So this right over here is 1 PM, 1 o'clock PM. So the test is going to begin at 1.59, so one minute before 2 PM. We know that there are 60 minutes in an hour. So 1.59 is one minute before 2 PM. So I'm not drawing it completely at scale, but this right over here is 1.59 PM. So we use one minute to get to 2 PM. And then, let's see, we have to get up to 96 minutes. So then you get another 60 minutes to go to 3 PM. So so far, we've used a cumulative 61. So this is one minute. So this is how long the test has been going on since the beginning. So one minute by 2 PM. 61 minutes by 3 PM. If we go all the way to 4 PM, that's going to be another 60. That would be 121 minutes, which is longer than the actual test. So we know that the entire test is 96 minutes. So we're going to get to some point right over here, some point like this that's 96 minutes. And what we need to figure out is, what is left over? What is this distance right over here? Or what is this time, this difference in time right over here? And so to figure that out, we need to figure out the time at which 96 minutes have passed since the beginning of the exam. So at 3 o'clock, 61 minutes have passed. And so if we say, well, how many more minutes have to go on for the end of the test? It's going to be 96 minus 61. So the amount of time that elapses past 3 minutes is 96 minus 61, which is 35 minutes. So this right over here is going to be 335. And so now our question is, how much time is there between 335 and 4 PM? Well, once again, 60 minutes in an hour. 4 PM is essentially the 60th minute. So if we take 60 minus 35, we get to 25. So she has 25. She has a total of 25 minutes remaining after the test before she has to get to volleyball practice. Just as a review, one minute between 1.59 and 2, then another 60, that gets us to 61 total minutes. Then another 35 minutes gets us to 96 minutes have passed. And that also gets us to 335, which means we have 25 minutes until 4.\n",

      "Transcription for y2mate.com - Translating expressions with parentheses  Algebric thinking  5th grade  Khan Academy_720pFH.mp3:\n",
      "What I hope to do in this video is give ourselves some practice interpreting statements and writing them as mathematical expressions, possibly using parentheses. So let's get started. And for any of these statements, if you get so inspired, and I encourage you to get so inspired, pause the video and see if you can write them as mathematical expressions. So this first one says 700 minus 19 divided in half. So we could say, another way to think about divided in half is divided by two. So we could write this as 709 minus 19, and we're going to do that first, so that's why I put the parentheses around it, divided by two, or divided in half. That's one way that we could write this. Now the next one. And once again, pause it if you get inspired, and I encourage you to. Three times the sum of 56 and seven. So it's going to be three times the sum of 56 and seven. So the sum of 56 and seven, we want to take that first. So it's going to be 56 plus seven. That's the sum of 56 and seven. And then we want to do three times that. We want to do three times this sum. So we could write it, we could write it like that. Another way we could write it, when you're dealing with parentheses, and you're going to see this more and more as you get into more and more fancy algebra, I guess you could say, but what I'm about to show you isn't so fancy, is you don't have to write the multiplication sign here. You could just write three, and then open parentheses, 56 plus seven, 56, 56 plus seven, and this too is three times the sum of 56 and seven. And you want to be very careful, because you might be tempted to maybe do it without the parentheses, so you might be tempted to do something like this. Three times, three times 56, 56 plus seven, but this one isn't obviously three times the sum of 56 and seven. In fact, the standard way to interpret this is that you would do the multiplication first. You would do three times 56, and then add seven, which is going to give you a different value, and you could try it out, than if you were to add the 56 and the seven first. So to make sure that you do the 56 and the seven first, you want to put this parentheses around it. So let's keep going. The sum of three times 56 and seven. So we're going to take the sum of two things. So we're going to take the sum of two things. The first thing that we're going to take the sum of is three times 56, so three times 56, and seven. And, let me do that in a different color, and seven. And seven. So this right over here is the sum of three times 56 and seven. Now, it's always good to write the parentheses. It makes it a little bit cleaner, a little bit more obvious. Look, I'm going to take the three times 56. I'm going to do that first, and then I'm going to add seven. But based on what I just told you, the standard way, if someone were to just write three times 56 plus seven, plus, let me write it, three times 56. If someone were to just write this, three times 56 plus seven, this actually can still be interpreted as the sum of three times 56 and seven. Because as I just said, the standard, the convention, so to speak, is to do your multiplication first. Order of operations, which you may or may not, if you're not familiar, you will be familiar with it soon, is to do the multiplication first, and then add the seven, or then do the addition. But just to make it clear, it doesn't hurt to put the parentheses there, three times 56 plus seven. Now, we have 43 minus the sum of 16 and 11. So, 43 minus, so we're going to have 43 minus minus the sum of 16 and 11. So, minus the sum of 16 and 11. So, from 43, we're going to take the sum of 16 and 11. And so, once again, the parentheses make it clear that we're going to take the sum of 16 and 11, and we're going to take that from 43. Parentheses are very, very, very important here. Because if we just did 43, 43 minus 16, minus 16, plus 11, the standard way of interpreting this would be 43 minus 16, and then adding 11, which would give you a different value than 43 minus the sum of 16 and 11. So, once again, the parentheses are very, very, very important here to emphasize, or to make it clear that you're going to add the 16 and 11 first, and then subtract that sum from 43. This is fun, let's keep going. 10 times the quotient of 104 and eight. So, we're going to do 10 times something. 10 times the quotient of 104 and eight. And so, the quotient of 104 and eight, we could write like this, 104 divided by eight. Or, based on what we told you a little earlier, you could write this as 10 times the quotient, the quotient of 104 and eight, or 104 divided by eight. Now, let's just do this last one. Four times as large. So, four times as large as the expression 175 minus 58. So, I'm going to do four times as large as something, so I'm going to multiply something times four, and I'm going to multiply, it's four times as large as the expression 175 minus 58. 175 minus 58. And once again, I could write it as four times, four times as large as the expression, let me do that in that purple color, as the expression 175 minus, 175 minus 58, either way. And once again, if you were to do it like this, if you didn't write the parentheses, then it wouldn't be the same thing, because if the parentheses weren't here, then you would want to do the four times 175 first, and then subtract the 58, which isn't what this statement is telling us. And this last one, I think, brings up an interesting thing for us to think about. Because if someone were to walk up to you on the street, and they were to show you, whoops, what's going on with my computer? And they were to show you two different expressions. Well, the first expression said two, let's write it this way, actually, I'm not going to even speak them out, I'm just going to write it down. I'm just going to write some crazy number here. Some crazy numbers here. So that's one expression that someone were to write. And let's say another one is this one. And I'm intentionally, oh wait, I put the commas in the wrong place. Let me make sure I get this right. All right, that's 183,576, this is 37,399. So that's one expression. And then another expression is this. And I'm intentionally not reading it out. Well, I'll read it out a little bit, 37,399. If someone said, quick, which expression is larger? And you might be tempted, or you might not be tempted, but you might be tempted, oh, let me calculate this thing, gee, I'm going to have to write this thing down, or use a calculator or something, or whatever else to add 183,576 plus 37,399, and then I'm going to have to multiply that by two and figure out what that number is equal to. And then I would have to take 183,576 plus 37,399 and figure out what that is, multiply that by seven and figure out what that's going to be. That's hard, that's going to take, not hard, it's just going to take you some time, you might make some careless mistakes. But the big realization to say, well, which one is larger? Well, I don't have to even calculate these things. Because this is two times this craziness right over here, this thing that's going to be 200 something thousand, and this is seven times that thing that is going to be 200 and something thousand. So seven times that thing is going to be larger than two times that thing. And so one way to, before you dive deep and start computing things, it's always good to take a step back and say, hey, look, can I look at kind of how the expressions are formed, the structure of these expressions, and say, look, this is two times this thing, and this is seven times this thing. Well, the seven is going to be, this one right over here is going to be, is going to be a larger expression. Anyway, hopefully you enjoyed that as much as I did.\n",

And for any of these statements, if you get so inspired, and I encourage you to get so inspired, pause the video and see if you can write them as mathematical expressions. So this first one says 700 minus 19 divided in half. So we could say, another way to think about divided in half is divided by two. So we could write this as 709 minus 19, and we're going to do that first, so that's why I put the parentheses around it, divided by two, or divided in half. That's one way that we could write this. Now the next one. And once again, pause it if you get inspired, and I encourage you to. Three times the sum of 56 and seven. So it's going to be three times the sum of 56 and seven. So the sum of 56 and seven, we want to take that first. So it's going to be 56 plus seven. That's the sum of 56 and seven. And then we want to do three times that. We want to do three times this sum. So we could write it, we could write it like that. Another way we could write it, when you're dealing with parentheses, and you're going to see this more and more as you get into more and more fancy algebra, I guess you could say, but what I'm about to show you isn't so fancy, is you don't have to write the multiplication sign here. You could just write three, and then open parentheses, 56 plus seven, 56, 56 plus seven, and this too is three times the sum of 56 and seven. And you want to be very careful, because you might be tempted to maybe do it without the parentheses, so you might be tempted to do something like this. Three times, three times 56, 56 plus seven, but this one isn't obviously three times the sum of 56 and seven. In fact, the standard way to interpret this is that you would do the multiplication first. You would do three times 56, and then add seven, which is going to give you a different value, and you could try it out, than if you were to add the 56 and the seven first. So to make sure that you do the 56 and the seven first, you want to put this parentheses around it. So let's keep going. The sum of three times 56 and seven. So we're going to take the sum of two things. So we're going to take the sum of two things. The first thing that we're going to take the sum of is three times 56, so three times 56, and seven. And, let me do that in a different color, and seven. And seven. So this right over here is the sum of three times 56 and seven. Now, it's always good to write the parentheses. It makes it a little bit cleaner, a little bit more obvious. Look, I'm going to take the three times 56. I'm going to do that first, and then I'm going to add seven. But based on what I just told you, the standard way, if someone were to just write three times 56 plus seven, plus, let me write it, three times 56. If someone were to just write this, three times 56 plus seven, this actually can still be interpreted as the sum of three times 56 and seven. Because as I just said, the standard, the convention, so to speak, is to do your multiplication first. Order of operations, which you may or may not, if you're not familiar, you will be familiar with it soon, is to do the multiplication first, and then add the seven, or then do the addition. But just to make it clear, it doesn't hurt to put the parentheses there, three times 56 plus seven. Now, we have 43 minus the sum of 16 and 11. So, 43 minus, so we're going to have 43 minus minus the sum of 16 and 11. So, minus the sum of 16 and 11. So, from 43, we're going to take the sum of 16 and 11. And so, once again, the parentheses make it clear that we're going to take the sum of 16 and 11, and we're going to take that from 43. Parentheses are very, very, very important here. Because if we just did 43, 43 minus 16, minus 16, plus 11, the standard way of interpreting this would be 43 minus 16, and then adding 11, which would give you a different value than 43 minus the sum of 16 and 11. So, once again, the parentheses are very, very, very important here to emphasize, or to make it clear that you're going to add the 16 and 11 first, and then subtract that sum from 43. This is fun, let's keep going. 10 times the quotient of 104 and eight. So, we're going to do 10 times something. 10 times the quotient of 104 and eight. And so, the quotient of 104 and eight, we could write like this, 104 divided by eight. Or, based on what we told you a little earlier, you could write this as 10 times the quotient, the quotient of 104 and eight, or 104 divided by eight. Now, let's just do this last one. Four times as large. So, four times as large as the expression 175 minus 58. So, I'm going to do four times as large as something, so I'm going to multiply something times four, and I'm going to multiply, it's four times as large as the expression 175 minus 58. 175 minus 58. And once again, I could write it as four times, four times as large as the expression, let me do that in that purple color, as the expression 175 minus, 175 minus 58, either way. And once again, if you were to do it like this, if you didn't write the parentheses, then it wouldn't be the same thing, because if the parentheses weren't here, then you would want to do the four times 175 first, and then subtract the 58, which isn't what this statement is telling us. And this last one, I think, brings up an interesting thing for us to think about. Because if someone were to walk up to you on the street, and they were to show you, whoops, what's going on with my computer? And they were to show you two different expressions. Well, the first expression said two, let's write it this way, actually, I'm not going to even speak them out, I'm just going to write it down. I'm just going to write some crazy number here. Some crazy numbers here. So that's one expression that someone were to write. And let's say another one is this one. And I'm intentionally, oh wait, I put the commas in the wrong place. Let me make sure I get this right. All right, that's 183,576, this is 37,399. So that's one expression. And then another expression is this. And I'm intentionally not reading it out. Well, I'll read it out a little bit, 37,399. If someone said, quick, which expression is larger? And you might be tempted, or you might not be tempted, but you might be tempted, oh, let me calculate this thing, gee, I'm going to have to write this thing down, or use a calculator or something, or whatever else to add 183,576 plus 37,399, and then I'm going to have to multiply that by two and figure out what that number is equal to. And then I would have to take 183,576 plus 37,399 and figure out what that is, multiply that by seven and figure out what that's going to be. That's hard, that's going to take, not hard, it's just going to take you some time, you might make some careless mistakes. But the big realization to say, well, which one is larger? Well, I don't have to even calculate these things. Because this is two times this craziness right over here, this thing that's going to be 200 something thousand, and this is seven times that thing that is going to be 200 and something thousand. So seven times that thing is going to be larger than two times that thing. And so one way to, before you dive deep and start computing things, it's always good to take a step back and say, hey, look, can I look at kind of how the expressions are formed, the structure of these expressions, and say, look, this is two times this thing, and this is seven times this thing. Well, the seven is going to be, this one right over here is going to be, is going to be a larger expression. Anyway, hopefully you enjoyed that as much as I did.\n",

      "Transcription for y2mate.com - Triangles categorization by angle or equal sides  4th grade  Khan Academy_720pFH.mp3:\n",
      "What I want to do in this video is talk about the two main ways that triangles are categorized. The first way is based on whether or not the triangle has equal sides, or at least a few equal sides. And the other way is based on the measure of the angles of the triangle. So the first categorization right here, and all of these are based on whether or not the triangle has equal sides, is scalene. And a scalene triangle is a triangle where none of the sides are equal. So for example, if I have a triangle like this, where this side has length 3, this side has length 4, and this side has length 5, then this is going to be a scalene triangle. None of the sides have an equal length. Now an isosceles triangle is a triangle where at least two of the sides have equal lengths. So for example, this would be an isosceles triangle. Maybe this has length 3, this has length 3, and this has length 2. Notice this side and this side are equal, so it meets the constraint of at least two of the three sides have the same length. Now an equilateral triangle, you might imagine, and you'd be right, is a triangle where all three sides have the same length. So for example, this would be an equilateral triangle. And let's say that this has side 2, 2, and 2. Or if I have a triangle like this, where it's 3, 3, and 3, any triangle where all three sides have the same length is going to be equilateral. Now you might say, well, Sal, didn't you just say that an isosceles triangle is a triangle that has at least two sides being equal? Wouldn't an equilateral triangle be a special case of an isosceles triangle? And I would say, yes, you are absolutely right. An equilateral triangle has all three sides equal, so it meets the constraints for an isosceles. So by that definition, all equilateral triangles are also isosceles triangles, but not all isosceles triangles are equilateral. So for example, this one right over here, this isosceles triangle, clearly not equilateral. All three sides are not the same. Only two are. But both of these equilateral triangles meet the constraint that at least two of the sides are equal. Now down here, we're going to classify based on angles. An acute triangle is a triangle where all of the angles are less than 90 degrees. So for example, a triangle like this, maybe this is 60. Let me draw it a little bit bigger so I can draw the angle measures. I want to make it a little bit more obvious. So let's say a triangle like this. If this angle is 60 degrees, maybe this one right over here is 59 degrees, and then this angle right over here is 61 degrees. Notice they all add up to 180 degrees. This would be an acute triangle. Notice all of the angles are less than 90 degrees. So less than 90 degree angles for all of them. A right triangle is a triangle that has one angle that is exactly 90 degrees. So for example, this right over here would be a right triangle. Maybe this angle or this angle is the one that's 90 degrees. And the normal way that this is specified, people wouldn't just do the traditional angle measure and write 90 degrees here. They would normally draw the angle like this. They would put a little, I guess, the edge of a box looking thing. And that tells you that this angle right over here is 90 degrees. And because this triangle has a 90 degree angle, and it can only have one 90 degree angle, this is a right triangle. So that is equal to 90 degrees. Now you could imagine an obtuse triangle based on the idea that an obtuse angle is larger than 90 degrees. An obtuse triangle is a triangle that has one angle that is larger than 90 degrees. So let's say that you have a triangle that looks like this, a triangle that looks something like this. Maybe this is 120 degrees. And then let's see. Let me make sure that this would make sense. Maybe this is 25 degrees. And maybe that is 35 degrees. This is 25 degrees. Notice they still add up to 180, or at least they should. 25 plus 35 is 60, plus 120 is 180 degrees. But the important point here is that we have an angle that is larger, that is greater than 90 degrees. Now you might be asking yourself, hey, Sal, can a triangle be multiple of these things? Can it be a right scalene triangle? Absolutely, you could have a right scalene triangle. In this situation right over here, actually a 3, 4, 5 triangle, a triangle that has lengths of 3, 4, and 5 actually is a right triangle. This right over here would be a 90 degree angle. You could have an equilateral acute triangle. In fact, all equilateral triangles, because all of the angles are exactly 60 degrees, all equilateral triangles are actually acute. So there's multiple combinations that you can have between these situations and these situations right over here.\n",

      "We've already seen that we can categorize triangles as being equilateral isosceles or scalene based on the lengths of the sides of the triangle. So if none of the lengths are congruent, so if you have something like this, we would consider this scalene. I'm assuming that this side is not equal to that side and neither of these are equal to that side. So that would be scalene and this is all a review. If I have at least two of the sides being equal, so let's say that side is the same length as that side right over there, we could call this, so I'll mark it off as these are the same length. This would be an isosceles, isosceles triangle. And then if all three of them, all three sides are congruent, so if all three sides are congruent, if all three sides are the same length, we would call this equilateral, equilateral. And in most circles, you could also say this is isosceles because isosceles would be at least two sides being equal, so this one definitely has at least two sides. It has all three. So this is, you could say, equilateral and isosceles, while this one, if we assume this third side is a different length, this would just be isosceles, not equilateral. Now all of that is review. Now what I wanna think about in this video is what if we're not given the lengths of the sides and what if we're just given a few of the angles? So for example, let's say we were given a triangle. Let's say that we were given a triangle where we're given a few of the angle measures. So let's say we are told that this angle right over here is, I don't know, let's say this angle right over here is 40 degrees and this angle right over here is 50 degrees. Now based on that, could you somehow classify this as scalene, isosceles, or equilateral? Well the key here to realize is if you know two angles, two interior angles of a triangle, you can always figure out the third because the three need to add up to 180 degrees. So if this is 40, that is 50. So these two add up to 90. So to add up to 180 degrees, this one must be a 90 degree angle. We can even mark it as a right angle. And so if you have a triangle where all of the interior angles are different, that means that all of the side lengths are going to be different. And one way to think about it is if this angle became wider, if this angle became wider, this length, let me actually show the corresponding. So if this angle, if that angle right over there became wider, then this length would have to become wider. If this angle became larger or smaller, then this side is going to have to become larger or smaller. And if this angle became larger or smaller, then this side is going to become larger and smaller. So hopefully you appreciate that if you have three different angles, you're going to have three different side lengths. So just based on the angles here, that we have three different angles, we can say that this is going to be a scalene triangle. Now, we can look at a couple other examples. What if we knew that, what if we knew, let's do an interesting one. What if this angle, let's say this angle is, let's say this angle right over here is, I don't know, let's say it is 70 degrees. And let's say this angle over here is 40 degrees. Now, based on the information I've given you, what kind of triangle is this going to be or can you even figure it out? Well, we use the same idea. The interior angles need to add up to 180. 70 plus 40 is 110. So you could say 110 plus what is equal to 180 degrees? Well, this is going to have to be 70 degrees. So this angle right over here is 70 degrees. And so now we have a scenario where two of the angles have the same measure. And so this angle is really, one way to think about it, based on whether this angle is large or small, it's going to define the length of that side. And this angle right over here, depending on how large or small it is, is going to define the length on this side. And so because these two angles are congruent, because they have the same measure, their opposite sides are going to be congruent. So this is going to be the same as that. And so just based on the information I had started giving you, because you can show that two angles are going to be the same, you can say that this is going to be an isosceles triangle. And now let's do a third example, and you could probably guess what I'm going to do in this third example. If I can, if I have, let's say this angle is 60 degrees, this angle is 60 degrees, what type of a triangle is this going to be? Well, if this is 60, this is 60, to make them add up to 180, this would have to be 60, that would have to be 60 degrees as well. And if you have all of the angles are congruent, then that means that all of the sides are congruent. And so now you're dealing with an equilateral. This is also, you can view this as a subset of isosceles because you have at least two angles and you have two sides being congruent, but here it's all three, so this is an equilateral triangle.\n",

      "We're told that Burger Barn makes dipping sauce by mixing two spoonfuls of honey with 1 1⁄2 spoonful of mustard. Sandwich Town makes dipping sauce by mixing four spoonfuls of honey with one spoonful of mustard. Which dipping sauce has a stronger mustard flavor? So pause this video and see if you can work through that on your own. All right, now let's think about the ratios of honey to mustard at each of these restaurants. So first, let's think about the scenario with Burger Barn. So I'll just say BB for short, for Burger Barn. So they have two spoonfuls of honey for every 1 1⁄2 spoonful of mustard. So the ratio of honey to mustard in terms of spoonfuls is two spoonfuls of honey for every 1 1⁄2 spoonful of mustard. So this is the ratio of honey to mustard. Let me write this. This is honey, and this right over here is mustard. Now let's look at Sandwich Town. So I'll call that ST. So Sandwich Town makes dipping sauce by having four spoonfuls of honey for every one spoonful of mustard. So the ratio of honey to mustard is four spoonfuls to one spoonful. So once again, that is honey and that is mustard. Now can we make these equivalent ratios or can we compare them somehow? Well, let's see. We have 1 1⁄2 spoonful of mustard here. We have one spoon of mustard here. So what if we multiplied both the mustard and the honey spoonfuls by two? That still would be an equivalent ratio because we're multiplying by the same amount. So if we multiply by two in both situations, you have four spoonfuls of honey for every one spoonful of mustard. Well, that's the exact same ratio that we have at Sandwich Town. So it actually turns out that they have the same concentration of mustard. They have the same ratio of honey to mustard, four spoonfuls of honey for every spoonful of mustard in either situation. Let's do another example. So here we are asked or we are told, we are told Patrick's favorite shade of purple paint is made with four ounces of blue paint. So I'm gonna underline that in blue. Four ounces of blue paint for every three ounces of red paint, for every three ounces of red paint. So the ratio of blue paint to red paint is four ounces of blue, four ounces of blue for every three ounces of red. So four to three. Which of the following paint mixtures will create the same shade of purple? All right, pause this video and see if you can figure it out on your own. So this is three ounces of blue paint mixed with four ounces of red paint. Well, this is a ratio here of three to four. And even though it's dealing with the same numbers, this is a different ratio. The order matters. This is four ounces of blue for every three ounces of red. This is saying three ounces of blue for every four ounces of red. So we could rule this one out. Eight ounces of blue paint mixed with six ounces of red paint. So here this ratio is eight ounces of blue for every six ounces of red. Well, are these equivalent ratios? Well, the difference, or you can go, if you multiply by two in either case, you will get to eight to six. Four times two is eight. Three times two is six. So this is indeed an equivalent ratio. So we would select this one. All right, here they say six ounces of blue paint mixed with eight ounces of red paint. So this is, once they've swapped the blues and the red relative to this one. So this is a ratio of six to eight. So let me write this down. So this is a ratio six ounces of blue paint for every eight ounces of red paint. So just like we ruled out that first one, this is dealing with the same numbers but in a different order, and the order matters. So we'll rule that out. 20 ounces of blue paint, 20 ounces of blue paint for every 15 ounces of red paint. So are these equivalent? Well, let's think about it. To go from four to 20, you could multiply by five. And to go from three to 15, you could multiply by five. So we could multiply by the same factor to go from four to three to 20 to 15. So this is indeed an equivalent ratio. 12 ounces of blue paint mixed with 16 ounces of red paint. All right, so this is a ratio here of 12 ounces of blue for every 16 ounces of red. So let's think about this. To go from four to 12, you would multiply by three. Now, if you multiplied three by three, you would have a nine here, not a 16. So this is definitely not an equivalent ratio. Another way of thinking about it, you have, in terms of ounces, you have more ounces of blue than you have of red for any of the equivalent ratios. But here, you have more ounces of red than blue. So once again, another way of realizing that that is not equivalent. So only B and D are the equivalent mixtures that will provide the same shade of purple. To have that same shade, you need the same ratio of blue to red.\n",

      "Convert 37 centimeters to meters. Let me write this over. 37, and I'll write centi in a different color to emphasize the prefix. 37 centimeters, and we want to convert it to meters. So we really just have to remind ourselves what the prefix centi means. Centi literally means 1 over 100, or 1 hundredth of a meter. So this is really saying 37 hundredth meters. So let's write it that way. This is literally 37 hundredths of a meter. So 1 hundredth meters. These are equivalent statements. So what are 37 hundredths of a meter? Well, that's going to be 37 hundredths of a meter, which can be rewritten as, if you wanted to write it as a decimal, that's 0 point. You could view it as 3 tenths and 7 hundredths or 37 hundredths, so 0.37 meters. Another way that you could have thought about this is, look, I'm going to go from centimeters to meters. I have 100. I need 100 centimeters to get to 1 meter. So I'm going to have to divide by 100 in order to figure out how many meters I have. And you should always do a reality check. If I convert centimeters to meters, should I get a larger number or a smaller number? Well, however many centimeters I have, I'm going to have a fewer number of meters. Meters is a larger unit. So you should have a smaller value here. It should be a smaller value by a factor of 100. So you literally could have started off with 37 centimeters. Let me write it this way, 37 centimeters. Actually, let's go through a couple of the units right over here. Now, if you wanted to turn it to decimeters, so this is 1 over 100. Decimeters, 1 over 1 tenth. So you would divide. This would be 3.7 decimeters. Let me write this as 3.7 decimeters. And a decimeter is 1 tenth of a meter. So you would divide by 10 again. So this is 0.37 meters. So one way to think about it is to go from centimeters to meters, you're going to divide by 100. Dividing by 100, you would move the decimal space over to the left two times. Doing it once divides by 10. Doing it twice divides by 100. So you get to 0.37 meters.\n",

      "Transcription for y2mate.com - Unit conversion gallons to quarts pints and cups  PreAlgebra  Khan Academy_720pFH.mp3:\n",
      "How many cups are in three and a half gallons? So before even addressing this question, let's just think about how large a cup is. And actually, I'll give you a little bit of overview of how many cups there are in a pint, how many pints in a quart, and how many quarts in a gallon. So let me just draw a little, let me draw a cube here. And let's imagine that this is a gallon. The most common time we see a gallon is when you see a gallon of milk. So let's say that that whole thing is a gallon. You can imagine if it had a handle, it would be kind of a big gallon of milk. Now, there are four quarts per gallon. Let me write this over here. There are four quarts per gallon. So if I were to draw the quarts here, I could divide this gallon into four quarts. And then each of these sections would be a quart. So you have four quarts. So this right here that I've just drawn in blue would be a exactly, that would be one quart. And obviously, there's four of them in this entire gallon. Now, you can divide the quarts into pints. You have two pints per quart. So this quart that I drew here, I can divide it into two, I can divide it into two like that. And this little section that I'm highlighting in magenta is a pint. That is a pint right over there. And then finally, there are two cups per pint. There are two cups per pint. So this pint right here, I can divide it into two, and each of these will be a cup. So this section right here will be a cup. Now, we could go straight and figure out exactly how many cups there are per gallon. Actually, that might be an interesting way to think about it. If you have four quarts, let's multiply it right here. So you have four quarts per gallon times two pints per quart, what does this give you? This gives you 4 times 2 is equal to 8. And then the quarts cancel out, and you have 8 pints per gallon. And that makes complete sense, because we had four quarts in this gallon, and then each of those quarts have two pints in them, so 4 times 2, so 8 pints per gallon. And then we can multiply that times two cups per pint. Actually, I could just copy and paste this right here. So let me just copy and paste this. Copy and paste. Actually, I should have cut and paste. So let me select it again. I want to do that so I get that real estate back. So edit, cut, edit, paste. There you go. So now you multiply this times two cups per pint. And the reason why this will work is because you have a pint in the numerator, cancels out with a pint in the denominator. And you will be left with, I'll go back to the yellow, 8 times 2 is 16. In the numerator, we have cups per gallon. Now, we just figured out how many cups there are per gallon. That makes sense. This section right here is exactly 1 16th of this entire cube, this entire gallon. But we haven't even answered our question. We want to figure out how many cups there are in 3 and 1 1⁄2 gallons. So let's write it over here. So we're concerned with 3 and 1 1⁄2 gallons. I don't like working with mixed numbers. I like to turn them into improper fractions. 3 and 1⁄2 is the same thing as 2 times 3 is 6 plus 1 is 7. This is the same thing as 7 over 2. If you divided 7 by 2, you would get 3 with the remainder of 1. Or this would be 3 and 1⁄2. So this is the exact same thing. So we want to know how many cups are in 7 halves gallons. So what we want to do is end up with cups, and we want the gallons to cancel out. So we have a gallons in the numerator right here, or it's definitely not in the denominator. And so we want to divide by gallons, and then we're going to have a numerator. We have cups in the numerator. And how many cups are there per gallon? Well, we just figure that out. There are 16 cups per gallon. When you multiply these two quantities, the gallons will cancel out, and you'll just be left with cups. And that's what we wanted. So it's going to be 7 halves times 16. So this is going to be 7 times 16 over 2 cups. And then 16 divided by 2, or you could divide 16 by 2 and get 8. 2 divided by 2 is 1, so it just becomes 7 times 8 divided by 1, or just 7 times 8, which is 56. So this is equal to 56 cups. And this should make sense. This should be a much larger number, because cups are a much smaller unit. So if you have 3 and 1⁄2 gallons, you will have many, many, many more cups in that 3 and 1⁄2 gallons. So this makes sense.\n",

      "How many cups are in three and a half gallons? So before even addressing this question, let's just think about how large a cup is. And actually, I'll give you a little bit of overview of how many cups there are in a pint, how many pints in a quart, and how many quarts in a gallon. So let me just draw a little, let me draw a cube here. And let's imagine that this is a gallon. The most common time we see a gallon is when you see a gallon of milk. So let's say that that whole thing is a gallon. You can imagine if it had a handle, it would be kind of a big gallon of milk. Now, there are four quarts per gallon. Let me write this over here. There are four quarts per gallon. So if I were to draw the quarts here, I could divide this gallon into four quarts. And then each of these sections would be a quart. So you have four quarts. So this right here that I've just drawn in blue would be a exactly, that would be one quart. And obviously, there's four of them in this entire gallon. Now, you can divide the quarts into pints. You have two pints per quart. So this quart that I drew here, I can divide it into two, I can divide it into two like that. And this little section that I'm highlighting in magenta is a pint. That is a pint right over there. And then finally, there are two cups per pint. There are two cups per pint. So this pint right here, I can divide it into two, and each of these will be a cup. So this section right here will be a cup. Now, we could go straight and figure out exactly how many cups there are per gallon. Actually, that might be an interesting way to think about it. If you have four quarts, let's multiply it right here. So you have four quarts per gallon times two pints per quart, what does this give you? This gives you 4 times 2 is equal to 8. And then the quarts cancel out, and you have 8 pints per gallon. And that makes complete sense, because we had four quarts in this gallon, and then each of those quarts have two pints in them, so 4 times 2, so 8 pints per gallon. And then we can multiply that times two cups per pint. Actually, I could just copy and paste this right here. So let me just copy and paste this. Copy and paste. Actually, I should have cut and paste. So let me select it again. I want to do that so I get that real estate back. So edit, cut, edit, paste. There you go. So now you multiply this times two cups per pint. And the reason why this will work is because you have a pint in the numerator, cancels out with a pint in the denominator. And you will be left with, I'll go back to the yellow, 8 times 2 is 16. In the numerator, we have cups per gallon. Now, we just figured out how many cups there are per gallon. That makes sense. This section right here is exactly 1 16th of this entire cube, this entire gallon. But we haven't even answered our question. We want to figure out how many cups there are in 3 and 1 1⁄2 gallons. So let's write it over here. So we're concerned with 3 and 1 1⁄2 gallons. I don't like working with mixed numbers. I like to turn them into improper fractions. 3 and 1⁄2 is the same thing as 2 times 3 is 6 plus 1 is 7. This is the same thing as 7 over 2. If you divided 7 by 2, you would get 3 with the remainder of 1. Or this would be 3 and 1⁄2. So this is the exact same thing. So we want to know how many cups are in 7 halves gallons. So what we want to do is end up with cups, and we want the gallons to cancel out. So we have a gallons in the numerator right here, or it's definitely not in the denominator. And so we want to divide by gallons, and then we're going to have a numerator. We have cups in the numerator. And how many cups are there per gallon? Well, we just figure that out. There are 16 cups per gallon. When you multiply these two quantities, the gallons will cancel out, and you'll just be left with cups. And that's what we wanted. So it's going to be 7 halves times 16. So this is going to be 7 times 16 over 2 cups. And then 16 divided by 2, or you could divide 16 by 2 and get 8. 2 divided by 2 is 1, so it just becomes 7 times 8 divided by 1, or just 7 times 8, which is 56. So this is equal to 56 cups. And this should make sense. This should be a much larger number, because cups are a much smaller unit. So if you have 3 and 1⁄2 gallons, you will have many, many, many more cups in that 3 and 1⁄2 gallons. So this makes sense.\n",

      "How many hours are in 549 minutes? And we can write it as a decimal or a fraction. So essentially, we're going to take 549 minutes and divide them into groups of 60. Why 60? Because we know that one hour is equal to 60 minutes. So it's essentially saying, how many groups of 60 minutes can we divide 549 into? Or another way of thinking about that Well, what is 549 divided into groups of 60? This is how many hours we're going to have. So let's do that. Let's take 549 and divide it by 60. So 6 goes into 54 9 times. So 60 is going to go into 549 times. We're going to have a little bit left over. So we have 9. 9 times 60 is 540. We subtract. We have 9 left over. I'll bring down the, let's see, we have 9 left over. And now, let's see, we have a little left over. So we're going to get a decimal. So let's put a decimal place right over here. And let's throw some 0's over there. Let's bring down a 0. So we bring down a 0. 60 goes into 90 one time. 1 times 60 is 60. And we subtract. We get 30. Let's bring down another 0. And so we get to 300. 60 goes into 300 five times. 5 times 60 is 30. So 5 times 60 is 300. Subtract. And we are done. So you divide 549 into groups of 60. You can divide it into 9.15 groups of 60 minutes. A group of 60 minutes is an hour. So this 549 minutes is 9.15 hours. I want to make sure that we can visualize that properly. So let's actually construct what 9.15 hours looks like. So let me draw a little line here. And on the top, I'll label hours. On the bottom, I'll label minutes. So this is 0 hours, 0 minutes. And now we have 1 hour, which is 60 minutes. Now we have 2 hours, which is 120 minutes. Then you have 3 hours, which is 180 minutes. Then you have 4 hours, which is 240 minutes. 5 hours is 300 minutes. 6 hours is 360 minutes. 7 hours, I might be running out of space, is 420 minutes. Let me copy and paste this in a place where I have more real estate. So let me clear that. And then let me paste that someplace where I don't run into my other math that I did. All right. So then you have 8 hours is 480 minutes. And then you have 9 hours. Notice I'm just adding 60 minutes every time. 9 hours is 540 minutes. Or another way you could think about it is, well, if each hour is 60, 9 times 60 is 540. And we don't want to go to just 540. We have another 9 left. So then we have to go another 9 minutes to go to 549. So you have a little 9 minutes left over. So another way of thinking about this is that 549 is 9 hours. And then you have 9 minutes left over. And 9 minutes is what fraction of an hour? Well, 60 minutes is a whole hour. So 9 minutes is 9 60ths of an hour. So you could write it this way. It's 9 and 9 60ths hours. Or we could write this as an equivalent fraction. 9 over 60 is the same thing if we divide the numerator and the denominator by 3. It's the same thing as 3 20ths. So we could write this as 9 and 3 20ths. And 3 over 20, well, we could figure out what that is going to be. Let's see, 20 divided by 3 is definitely going to be smaller than 1, because 3 is smaller than 20. So let's throw some 0's on here. 20 doesn't go into 3, but it does go into 30 one time. 1 times 20 is 20. Subtract, get a 10, bring down a 0. 20 goes into 100 5 times. 5 times 20 is 100. And we are done. So notice, 3 over 20 is the exact same thing. So 9 and 3 20ths is the exact same thing as 9 and 15 100ths. These are all equivalent answers.\n",

      "We're asked to arrange the following measurements in order from smallest to largest. And we have the measurements, and there are different units. This is in decameters, then we have meters, and we have millimeters, then we have centimeters. So the way I would tackle this is I would try to convert them all to the same units, maybe meters, and then compare them all in terms of meters. So let's do that. So this is just a screenshot of that exact same screen we just saw there. And so let's just convert each of these into meters. So the first one we have right over here is 1 decameter. So we have to remind ourselves what deca even means. Well, deca is equal to 10 meters. And actually, let me add more of these just so that we know all of the different prefixes we could have. So you have deca, you have hecto, which would be 100, you have kilo, which would be 1,000. And then, of course, you just have meters, and you'd have no prefix there. That would just be equal 1 if you have no prefix in front of the meters. And then if you have a tenth of a meter, that is decameter. So this is 1 tenth. Then you have centi, which is 1 hundredth. And then you have milli, which is equal to 1 thousandth. So let's use this information right over here to figure out how many meters each of these are. So 1 decameter, we just saw deca means 10. That's 1 times 10 meters. So this is going to be equal to 10 meters. So this right over here is 10 meters. This is already written in meters. This is 13 meters. Then we have 15,000 millimeters. So it's 15,000 millimeters. But milli means 1 thousandth. So it's 15,000 times 1 thousandth of a meter. So each millimeter is 1 thousandth of a meter. You could view this as, instead of writing a milli here, I wrote 1 thousandth. So 15,000 times 1 thousandth, that's just going to give me 15. So this is going to be 15 meters. So this is 15 meters. Another way of thinking about it is, look, 1,000 millimeters is equal to a meter. So let's divide this into groups of 1,000. Well, this is literally 15 groups of 1,000. This is 15 groups of 1,000 millimeters. So that's going to be 15 meters. And then finally, we have 1,900 centimeters. So 1,900, instead of writing centi, I'm going to write 1 hundredth of a meter. Well, 1,900 times 1 over 100 is 19. So this is equal to 19 meters. Another way of thinking about it is, this is 19 groups of 100 centimeters. And 100 centimeters is equal to a meter. So this is 19 meters right over here. So let's go back to the actual problem. So let's remind ourselves, this right over here, this is 10 meters. This is 13 meters. So 10, 13. This right over here was 15 meters. And this right over here was 19 meters. So actually, the order that they already gave it to us in, we could obviously swap things around if we wanted to. But the order that they already gave it to was the order from smallest to largest. This is 10 meters, 13 meters, 15 meters, and 19 meters.\n",

      "We're asked how many inches are in 4 1⁄2 yards? And we'll do it a couple of ways. One, we could just say how many inches are in 4 yards and how many inches are in 1⁄2 a yard. And this is really 4 plus 1⁄2 yards. Or we can convert this into an improper fraction first and then convert. But before I even do that, let's just think about how many inches there are in a yard. So if I have 1 yard, we know that there are 3 feet for every 1 yard. And when you say, wait, why am I multiplying by 3 instead of saying there's 1 yard for every 3 feet? And the easiest way to think about it is you're going to have a larger value over here. And you're also going to want to have these units right over here cancel out. So yard is canceling out with yard. So you have 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, which is kind of what we already knew. I'm just showing you how the dimensions cancel out. And how many inches are there per foot? Well, we know that there are 12 inches for every 1 foot. And same logic over here. Inches is a smaller unit of measurement. So it makes sense that we're multiplying by 12. 3 feet is going to be more inches. We're multiplying by 12. And also, these units cancel out. Foot in the numerator, foot in the denominator. 3 times 12 divided by 1 is equal to 36 inches. So you might have already known it. But this is nice to have the dimensions cancel out like this. We know that 1 yard is equal to 36 inches. Or there are 36 inches for every 1 yard. And so we can now either break this down, or we can turn this into an improper fraction. First, I'll just break it down into 4 yards plus 1 half yards. So we could say that this is 4 yards. So 4 yards is going to be equal to, well, let's just multiply it times 36 inches for every 1 yard. The yards cancel out. 4 times 36 is 120 plus 24. So that's 144. So this is equal to 144 inches. That's just the 4 yards. And then if we do the half yards, so 1 half of a, I guess I'd say 1 half yard, once again, times 36 inches per yard. The yards cancel out. 1 half times 36 is going to be equal to 18 inches. So 4 and 1 half yards is the same thing as 4 yards plus 1 half yards, which is the same thing as 144 inches plus 18 inches, which is going to give us, let's just add it up over here on the right, 144 plus 18. 4 plus 8 is 12. 4 plus 1 is 5. You have this 1 up here. So it's 6. And then we have a 1. So when you add them all together, you get 162 inches. The other way to do this would have been to convert this into an improper fraction and then multiply by the unit. So let's do it that way. If I have 4 and 1 half of anything, really, so let me write 4 and 1 half, trying to find a suitable color. So if I have 4 and 1 half, this is the same thing. 4 is the same thing as 8 halves. This is the same thing. So let me write it this way. 4 and 1 half is the same thing as 4 plus 1 half, which is the same thing as 4. If we want to have it at the same denominator as this 2 over here or as this 1 half over here, this is the same thing as 8 over 2. Or you could say 4 over 1 is the same thing as 8 over 2 if we want to have a common denominator. So 8 over 2 plus 1 over 2. Actually, let me write it that way just so you really understand what we're doing. 4 is the same thing as 4 over 1. So it's 4 over 1 plus 1 half. If we want to find a common denominator, it's 2. So 4 over 1 is the same thing as 8 over 2 plus 1 half, which is equal to 9 halves. Now, I did it this way, which takes longer, just so you really understand how we converted it, why it makes, hopefully, conceptually, why it just makes intuitive sense why 4 and 1 half is the same thing as 9 halves. But if you want a simple process for it, you could just say, look, 4 times 2 is 8. 8 plus 1 is 9. And that gives you that 9 right over there. So 9 halves. So we have 9 half yards that we want to convert to inches. So we have 9 half yards that we want to convert to inches. Same process. Times 36 inches per yards. Yard in the numerator, yard in the denominator. We are left with 9 over 2 times 36. We could say times 36 over 1 if we like. Times 36 over 1. 36 inches for every 1 yard. Or the number 36 really is the same as 36 over 1. And then we're left with just inches in our units. We're just left with inches. And over here, there's several ways that we can simplify it. Probably the easiest way to simplify it is we can divide both our numerator and our denominator by 2. So let me write it this way. I don't want to skip steps. So we have 9 times 36 over 2 times 1, or over 2 inches. And we can divide the numerator and the denominator by 2 to simplify it. They're both divisible by 2. 36 divided by 2 is 18. 2 divided by 2 is 1. So we're really just left with 9 times 18 inches. And we can just multiply 9 times 18. Let me do it over here. 18 times 9. 8 times 9 is 72. 1 times 9 is 9, plus 7 is 16. So we get 162 inches. So all of this simplifies to 162 inches. And we are done.\n",

And this is really 4 plus 1⁄2 yards. Or we can convert this into an improper fraction first and then convert. But before I even do that, let's just think about how many inches there are in a yard. So if I have 1 yard, we know that there are 3 feet for every 1 yard. And when you say, wait, why am I multiplying by 3 instead of saying there's 1 yard for every 3 feet? And the easiest way to think about it is you're going to have a larger value over here. And you're also going to want to have these units right over here cancel out. So yard is canceling out with yard. So you have 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, which is kind of what we already knew. I'm just showing you how the dimensions cancel out. And how many inches are there per foot? Well, we know that there are 12 inches for every 1 foot. And same logic over here. Inches is a smaller unit of measurement. So it makes sense that we're multiplying by 12. 3 feet is going to be more inches. We're multiplying by 12. And also, these units cancel out. Foot in the numerator, foot in the denominator. 3 times 12 divided by 1 is equal to 36 inches. So you might have already known it. But this is nice to have the dimensions cancel out like this. We know that 1 yard is equal to 36 inches. Or there are 36 inches for every 1 yard. And so we can now either break this down, or we can turn this into an improper fraction. First, I'll just break it down into 4 yards plus 1 half yards. So we could say that this is 4 yards. So 4 yards is going to be equal to, well, let's just multiply it times 36 inches for every 1 yard. The yards cancel out. 4 times 36 is 120 plus 24. So that's 144. So this is equal to 144 inches. That's just the 4 yards. And then if we do the half yards, so 1 half of a, I guess I'd say 1 half yard, once again, times 36 inches per yard. The yards cancel out. 1 half times 36 is going to be equal to 18 inches. So 4 and 1 half yards is the same thing as 4 yards plus 1 half yards, which is the same thing as 144 inches plus 18 inches, which is going to give us, let's just add it up over here on the right, 144 plus 18. 4 plus 8 is 12. 4 plus 1 is 5. You have this 1 up here. So it's 6. And then we have a 1. So when you add them all together, you get 162 inches. The other way to do this would have been to convert this into an improper fraction and then multiply by the unit. So let's do it that way. If I have 4 and 1 half of anything, really, so let me write 4 and 1 half, trying to find a suitable color. So if I have 4 and 1 half, this is the same thing. 4 is the same thing as 8 halves. This is the same thing. So let me write it this way. 4 and 1 half is the same thing as 4 plus 1 half, which is the same thing as 4. If we want to have it at the same denominator as this 2 over here or as this 1 half over here, this is the same thing as 8 over 2. Or you could say 4 over 1 is the same thing as 8 over 2 if we want to have a common denominator. So 8 over 2 plus 1 over 2. Actually, let me write it that way just so you really understand what we're doing. 4 is the same thing as 4 over 1. So it's 4 over 1 plus 1 half. If we want to find a common denominator, it's 2. So 4 over 1 is the same thing as 8 over 2 plus 1 half, which is equal to 9 halves. Now, I did it this way, which takes longer, just so you really understand how we converted it, why it makes, hopefully, conceptually, why it just makes intuitive sense why 4 and 1 half is the same thing as 9 halves. But if you want a simple process for it, you could just say, look, 4 times 2 is 8. 8 plus 1 is 9. And that gives you that 9 right over there. So 9 halves. So we have 9 half yards that we want to convert to inches. So we have 9 half yards that we want to convert to inches. Same process. Times 36 inches per yards. Yard in the numerator, yard in the denominator. We are left with 9 over 2 times 36. We could say times 36 over 1 if we like. Times 36 over 1. 36 inches for every 1 yard. Or the number 36 really is the same as 36 over 1. And then we're left with just inches in our units. We're just left with inches. And over here, there's several ways that we can simplify it. Probably the easiest way to simplify it is we can divide both our numerator and our denominator by 2. So let me write it this way. I don't want to skip steps. So we have 9 times 36 over 2 times 1, or over 2 inches. And we can divide the numerator and the denominator by 2 to simplify it. They're both divisible by 2. 36 divided by 2 is 18. 2 divided by 2 is 1. So we're really just left with 9 times 18 inches. And we can just multiply 9 times 18. Let me do it over here. 18 times 9. 8 times 9 is 72. 1 times 9 is 9, plus 7 is 16. So we get 162 inches. So all of this simplifies to 162 inches. And we are done.\n",

      "On Judy's way home from school yesterday, she ran for half the distance. Then she skipped for 1 4th of the remaining distance and walked the rest of the way home. She walked for a total of 360 feet. What is the distance between school and Judy's home? And they say write the answer in yards. So this is a little tricky right over here. They say 360 feet, write the answer in yards. And we have to remind ourselves that 1 yard is equal to 3 feet. So just so we make sure we don't make that careless mistake, let's put all of our information in yards right now. So 360 feet is how many yards? Well, there's 3 feet per yard, so we're just going to divide 360 feet by 3. And so 360 divided by 3 is 120 yards. And now we can continue to do the whole problem in terms of yards. So let's think about it. If we make the entire distance, so let me say that this is her entire distance. This is on her way home from school. So this is school, and then let me draw a line that shows the distance all the way home. So I'm going to draw it as large as possible so we have room to write inside of it. So that's school, that that is home. And they first tell us that she ran for half the distance. So let's split this in two. And so she ran for half the distance. This is the distance that she ran. It's half the total distance. So she ran for half the distance. Then they say, then she skipped for 1 fourth of the remaining distance. So let's be clear, the remaining distance is what I haven't filled in in orange yet. So let's mark that off into fourths of the remaining distance. So that is half the remaining distance. That's 1 fourth, 2 fourths, or this is 1 fourth, 2 fourths, 3 fourths. So we took the remaining distance and we divided it into fourths. And they say, then she skipped for 1 fourth of the remaining distance. So this is the remaining distance. After running, she skipped for 1 fourth of it. And then she walked the rest of the way home. So she walked the rest of the way home. This is the distance that she walked. And this distance right over here is 120 yards. What is the distance between school and Judy's home? So there's a bunch of ways that you could think about this. When we talked about the remaining distance after running, so this was the remaining distance after she ran, after this orange part right over here, you see that this blue section is 3 fourths of that remaining distance. 120 yards is 3 fourths of this remaining distance. So this is equal to 3 fourths of the remaining distance. So how much is 1 fourth of each of those remaining distance? Well, as this is 3 fourths, 1 fourth is going to be 1 third of this. 1 third of 120 is 40. So this distance right over here is 40. This is 40. This is 40. Notice 40 plus 40 plus 40 is 120. And this right over here is also going to be 40. These are all in terms of yards. So the remaining distance is going to be 40 times 4, or 160 yards. So this is 160 yards. Now, what is the total distance? Well, this 160 yards, the remaining distance after she ran, that's half the total distance. So if this is 160 yards, then this is going to be 160 yards as well. So 160 yards plus 160 yards gives us a total distance from school to home of 320 yards.\n",

Now, what is the total distance? Well, this 160 yards, the remaining distance after she ran, that's half the total distance. So if this is 160 yards, then this is going to be 160 yards as well. So 160 yards plus 160 yards gives us a total distance from school to home of 320 yards.\n",

      "Jameer is training for a race and is running laps around a field. If the distance around the field is 300 yards, how many complete laps would he need to do to run at least 2 miles? So they tell us how far one lap is, it's 300 yards, but we need to figure out how many laps to go 2 miles. So a good starting point would be to get everything into the same units. We have distance here in terms of miles, we have it here in terms of yards. So let's just get everything into yards. So he needs to run 2 miles. So 2 miles, how do we convert that to yards? Well I don't have it memorized how many yards there are per mile, but I do have it memorized how many feet there are per mile. And it's a good thing to have in the back of your brain someplace. That in general you have 5,280 feet per mile. It's a good number to know, 5,280 feet per mile. So if we want to convert, we could first convert the miles to feet, and then we know that there are 3 feet per yard, and then we'll have 2 miles in terms of yards. So 2 miles, if we want it converted to feet, we want miles in the denominator. So you want miles in the denominator, and we want feet in the numerator. And the reason why I say that is so that this miles will cancel out with that miles, and we'll just have feet there. And I just wrote down, there's 5,280 feet per mile. Or you say 5,280 feet for every 1 mile. You could write it either way, but let's just write it like that. And then we could multiply. So this is going to give us what? If we just multiply the numbers, 2 times 5,280, so what is that going to be? Maybe I should get a calculator out. Well we could do that in our head. Let's think of it this way. So it's going to be 400 plus 160 is going to be 560. And then 2 times 5,000 is 10,000. So it's 10,560. And then the miles cancel out, and we are just left with feet. And maybe, let me actually multiply it out. I did it in my head that time, but that's not always useful. Let me verify for you that 5,280 times 2 is indeed 10,560. So 2 times 0 is 0. 2 times 8 is 16. Carry the 1. 2 times 2 is 4, plus 1 is 5. 2 times 5 is 10. 10,560. So he needs to run 10,560 feet. We want this in terms of yards. So 10,560 feet, let's convert this to yards. Well we want it in yards, so we want yards in the numerator. We want yards in the numerator, and we want feet in the denominator. So the feet cancel out with that feet right there. And we know that there are 3 feet for every 1 yard. 3 feet for every 1 yard. Or another way to read this is that you have 1 third of a yard for every foot. And now we can multiply. And it makes sense. If you're going from feet to yards, the number should get smaller, because yards is a bigger unit. You need fewer yards to go the same distance as a certain number of feet. So it makes sense that we're dividing. Same thing. 2 miles is a ton of feet, so it made sense that we were multiplying by a large number. Here it makes sense that we're dividing. So let's do this. So this becomes 10,560 times 1 divided by 3. So it's 10,560 over 3. That's that and that part. And then the feet cancel out, and we're just left with yards. So this is 2 miles is 10,560 divided by 3. And let's figure out what that is. So 3 goes into 10,560. It doesn't go into 1. It goes into 10 3 times. 3 times 3 is 9. And we subtract. We get 1. Bring down this 5. It becomes a 15. 3 goes into 15 5 times. 5 times 3 is 15. We have no remainder, or 0. You bring down the 6. 3 goes into 6 2 times. Let me scroll down a little bit. 2 times 3 is 6. Subtract. No remainder. Bring down this last 0. 3 goes into 0. 0 times 0 times 3 is 0. And we have no remainder. So this is going to be 2 miles is equivalent to 3,520 yards. That's the total distance he has to travel. That's the equivalent of 2 miles. Now, we want to figure out how many laps there are. We want this in terms of laps, not in terms of yards. So we want the yards to cancel out. We want the yards to cancel out. And we want a laps in the numerator. Right? Because then when you multiply, the yards will cancel out. We'll just be left with laps. Now, how many laps are there per yard or yards per lap? Well, they say the distance around the field is 300 yards. So we have 300 yards for every 1 lap. So now if we multiply this right here, the yards will cancel out. And we will get 3,520. Let me do that in a different color. We will get 3,520. That right there. Times 1 over 300. When you multiply it times 1, it just becomes 3,520. Divided by 300. And in terms of the units, the yards canceled out. We're just left with the laps. So this is how many laps he needs to run. So 3,520 divided by 300. Well, we can eyeball this right here. What is 11 times 300? Let's just approximate this right here. So if we did 11 times 300, what is that going to be equal to? Well, 11 times 3 is 33. And then we have two 0's here. So this will be 3,300. So it's a little bit smaller than that. If we have 12 times 300, what is that going to be? 12 times 3 is 36. And then we have these two 0's. So it's equal to 3,600. So this is going to be 11 point something. It's larger than 11, right? 3,520 is larger than 3,300. So when you divide by 300, you're going to get something larger than 11. But this number right here is smaller than 3,600. So when you divide it by 300, you're going to get something a little bit smaller than 12. So the exact number of laps is going to be a little bit lower than 12 laps. So 2 miles is a little bit lower than 12 laps. But let's make sure we're answering their question. How many complete laps would he need to do to run at least 2 miles? So they're telling us that, look, this might be, I don't know, 11 point something something something laps. And that would be the exact number of laps to run 2 miles. But they say, how many complete laps does he have to run? 11 complete laps would not be enough. He would have to run 12. So our answer here is 12 complete laps. That complete tells us that they want a whole number of laps. We can't just divide this. If we divide this, we're going to get 11 point something something. You can do it with a calculator or do it by hand if you're interested. But we have to do at least 12, because that's the smallest whole number of laps that will get us to at least this distance right here, or this number of laps, or the equivalent of 2 miles.\n",

      "A local hospital recently conducted a blood drive where they collected a total of 80 pints of blood from donors. The hospital was hoping to collect a total of 8 gallons of blood from the drive. Did they meet their goal? How much more or less than their goal did the hospital collect? So really, they collected 80 pints. We just need to figure out how many gallons that is and then say, well, is that going to be more or less than 8 gallons? So we start with 80 pints, and we could take it step by step. You may or may not know how many pints there are per gallon. So let's just go straight to quarts first, and then from quarts we can go to gallons. But if you know right from the get-go how many pints there are per gallon, you could go there. So let's convert this to quarts. So we have 80 pints, so what are we going to multiply or divide it by to get quarts? Well, one way to think about it, you're going from a smaller unit, pints, to a larger unit. So you're going to have less of that larger unit. So you're going to divide. This number is going to be smaller when it goes into quarts. And it's going to be smaller by a factor of 2, because you have 2 pints per quart. So you're not going to multiply by 2. You're not going to have more quarts. You're going to divide by 2. So you could say times 1 half. This is the same thing as dividing by 2, and we'll make sure that the units work out. We have 1 quart for every 2 pints. Or you could use this as 2 pints per quart, or 1 half of a quart per pint. Either way, the units work out, and you're essentially taking 80 and dividing by 2, or multiplying by 1 half, and you get 40 quarts. And I want to make sure that your brain does it both ways. Because when you're just doing it, you don't have paper, you don't have the units around, you should just think, hey, 80 pints, there's 2 pints per quart. I'm going to have half as many quarts. I'm going to have 40 quarts. But when problems get a little more complicated, it is nice to make sure that the units cancel out in this way, so that you know, OK, 1 quart is 2 pints. Pints in the denominator, pints in the numerator, cancel them out. I just left with quarts and 80 times 1 half, which is 40. So we have 40 quarts now. And now we can convert this to gallons. We know that there are 4 quarts per gallon, or that 1 gallon has 4 quarts. And once again, we're going to go from a smaller unit to a larger unit, to gallons. So we know there's a factor of 4 difference. Since you're going to a larger unit, your brain should say, hey, I'm going to divide by 4. I'm going to have a factor of 4 fewer gallons, because it's a larger unit. And to make sure that units work out, you just remember, well, we have a quarts up here in the numerator. You're going to want a quarts down here in the denominator. And we care about converting into gallons. And 1 gallon is 4 quarts. And this will work out. The quarts will cancel out. And notice, you're also dividing by 4. 40 times 1 fourth is the exact same thing as 40 divided by 4, which makes sense. We're going to a larger unit. So 40 times 1 fourth is 10. And the units left are gallons. So the 80 pints of blood that the hospital collected is 10 gallons. Their goal was only 8 gallons. So did they meet their goal? Yes, they met their goal. How much more or less than their goal did the hospital collect? Well, their goal was 8. They collected 10. They collected 2 extra gallons than their goal.\n",

      "A local hospital recently conducted a blood drive where they collected a total of 80 pints of blood from donors. The hospital was hoping to collect a total of 8 gallons of blood from the drive. Did they meet their goal? How much more or less than their goal did the hospital collect?

      "A standard elevator in a mid-rise building can hold a maximum weight of 1.5 tons. Assuming an average adult weight of 160 pounds, what is the maximum number of adults who could safely ride the elevator? So what we need to do is we have to get the maximum weight that the elevator can hold in terms of pounds, and then say, OK, well, how many adults is that? So they gave us the maximum weight in terms of tons. So they say it is 1 and 1.5 tons. And it's always easier to deal with improper fractions than mixed numbers. So let's write this as an improper fraction. So 1 and 1.5 tons is the same thing as, well, 1 ton is 2 halves, and then you add another 1 half, that's 3 halves. So you get 3 halves tons. Or another way to think about it is 2 times 1 is 2, plus 1 is 3. So the maximum capacity is 3 halves tons. Let's think about how many pounds that is. And to do that, we have to know that there are 2,000 pounds per ton. Let me write this up here. We know that there are 2,000 pounds per ton. This wasn't given in the problem anywhere. This is something I knew from past experience, and it's a good thing to know in general that a ton is 2,000 pounds. So I'm going to write it right over here. Now, how do we convert these 3 halves tons into pounds? Well, we're going to multiply it by something. And the units that we're going to multiply by, we want the tons to cancel out. So we're going to want to have tons in the denominator, so it cancels out with this tons up here. And then we want pounds in the numerator. And that's exactly what we wrote up here. There are 2,000 pounds for every 1 ton, or you could just say 2,000 pounds per ton. You could put the 1 there, but it doesn't really change the expression. Now, if we multiply 3 halves tons times 2,000 pounds per ton, what'll happen is that the tons cancel out. That was the whole point of multiplying it by this. And we would be left with 3 halves times 2,000. And the only unit left is pounds. And if you do it this way, you'll never get confused. You'll know that the units cancel out, so you're getting the right units. But if you just think about it in your mind, it should also make sense. If there are 2,000 pounds per ton, and there are 1 and 1 half tons, I should multiply 1 and 1 half times 2,000 to get the number of pounds. That makes sense. We know 1 and 1 half times 2,000 is 3,000, but we'll figure it out right here. So what is 3 halves times 2,000? I just told you the answer. We can actually simplify it right over here. This is going to be 3 times 2,000 over 2 pounds. We can divide the numerator and the denominator by 2. This will become 1,000, and this will become 1. So it's 3 times 1,000 pounds, where this is equal to 3,000 pounds. So what we've done so far, we've just figured out the maximum capacity of the elevator. It can hold 1 and 1 half tons, which is the exact same thing as 3,000 pounds. Now, what we need to figure out is 3,000 pounds is equivalent to how many average adults of 160 pounds? Or how many 160-pound people would it take to weigh a total of 3,000 pounds? Well, we can just divide by 160. And if you want to make sure that the units work out, remember, we want our answer to be in terms of people, and we want the pounds to cancel out. So we have a pound in the numerator here, so if we divide by pounds, the pounds will cancel out, and then we want our leftover to be people, or maybe person. Person, people, same thing. Let me do people. The grammar of it, of doing singular plural, might make it a little confusing, but I think you get the general idea. Now, if we were to write this out, what does it tell us? One person weighs 160 pounds, so there's one people, or one person, for every 160 pounds. So notice, if we multiply these two expressions, the pounds will cancel out, we'll be just left with people, but we're really just dividing. We're multiplying 3,000 times 1 over 160, but it's really just taking 3,000 and dividing by 160, which makes sense. We have a capacity of 3,000, each of our people weighs 160 pounds. Divide by 160 tells you how many people, but this way you know that the units are working out. So this is going to be equal to 3,000 over 160 people. That is the maximum capacity of the elevator in terms of average people. Now, what is this? Well, we can divide the numerator and the denominator by 10. If we divide the numerator and the denominator by 10, this becomes 300 over 16. If we divide 300 by 2, this becomes 150. If we divide 16 by 2, this becomes 8. Now, let's see, what can we do more here? Well, we can divide by 2 again. Let me rewrite it, I don't want this to get. So this is the same thing as 150 over 8 people. See, 150 we can divide by 2, this gives us 75. And if you take 8 divided by 2, that is 4. So we have 75 divided by 4 people. Let me just do that, work it out. So you have 75 divided by 4. 4 goes into 7 one time. 1 times 4 is 4. You subtract. 7 minus 4 is 3. Bring down this 5. 4 goes into 35 8 times. 8 times 4 is 32. Subtract. 5 minus 2 is 3. And then you have the decimal. We're going to the right of the ones place. We're going to the tenths place now. So we can bring down a 0 over here. 4 goes into 30 7 times. 7 times 4 is 28. You subtract, you get 2. Bring down another 0. 4 goes into 20 exactly 5 times. 5 times 4 is 20. And then we are done. So this expression is exactly the 3,000 divided by 160, or the 150 divided by 8, or the 75 divided by 4. It all turns out to be 18.75 people is the capacity of the elevator. 18.75 average 160 pound people would weigh 3,000 pounds. Now did they want a decimal? What is the maximum number of adults who could safely ride the elevator? Well, if they're all going to be average, then the maximum of adults, since you can't have 3 quarters of a person, or 75 hundredths of a person, the maximum number is going to be 18. If you have 19 average weight adults, you're going to be too heavy and the elevator will fall or something.\n",

      "Mary made 15,000 milliliters of tea for a party, and she served the tea divided equally in eight pitchers. Her guests drank six pitchers of tea. How much tea did Mary have left over? Write the answer as a whole number of liters and a whole number of milliliters. So let's think about this a little bit. She's got eight pitchers, so let's visualize these pitchers. So let me see if I can, see, let me draw a pitcher here. So this is one pitcher. Let me do my best to draw a nice pitcher. So this is one pitcher, and she's gonna put the same amount of tea in every pitcher. So the same amount of tea in every pitcher, and let me copy and paste this. So copy and paste. So she's gonna have eight of these. So that's two, three, four, five, six, seven, and eight. So she wants to put the exact same amount of fluid in each of these eight. So she's gonna divide evenly the 15,000 milliliters into eight pitchers. So that's straight up division. She's gonna start with 15,000 milliliters, 15,000, and she's gonna divide it by eight. She's gonna divide it into eight equal groupings, or eight equal pitchers, or the same amount in each of the pitchers. So eight goes into, doesn't go to one. It goes into 15 one time. One times eight is eight. Subtract, 15 minus eight is seven. So bring down a zero. Eight goes into 70 eight times. Eight times eight is 64. Subtract, we get a six. Bring down another zero. Eight goes into 60 seven times. Seven times eight is 56. Subtract again, we get a four. Then bring down a zero again. Eight goes into 40 exactly five times. Five times eight is 40, and we're not left with a remainder. So if we divide 15,000 milliliters into eight equal sections, each pitcher is going to have exactly 1,875 milliliters. So that's 1,875 milliliters. But that's not what they're asking us for. They tell us that her guest drank six pitchers of tea, and how much tea did Mary have left over? So the guest drank one, two, three, four, five, six, leaving two pitchers left. How much total tea is going to be in that? Well, it's gonna be two times 1,875, or 1,875 milliliters times two. Let's figure out what that is. Two times five is 10. Two times seven is 14, plus one is 15. Two times eight is 16, plus one is 17. Two times one is two, plus one is three. So what she's left over with is 3,750 milliliters. Now, they want our answer in terms of a whole number of liters and a whole number of milliliters. And we just have to remind ourselves that 1,000 milliliters is equal to one liter. So you could rewrite this. This is the total number of milliliters that she's left with. We could rewrite this as 3,000 milliliters plus 750 milliliters. Now, the reason I wrote it this way is because of 3,000 milliliters. This is literally 3,000 one-thousandths of a milliliter. We already saw that 1,000 milliliters equaled one liter, so this piece right over here, this is equal to three liters. This is equal to three liters. So if we wanted to write it as a whole number of liters and a whole number of milliliters, this would be three liters, three liters, and 750 milliliters, 750 milliliters.\n",

Let's see which of these are US customary units versus metric units. So the liter is a metric unit. You would use it in the metric system. A gallon is a US customary unit. We've been dealing with that. If you fill your gasoline in Europe, you're going to be filling it in terms of liters. In the US, you're going to be filling it in terms of gallons. And we're going to talk about whether they're units of volume and whatnot in a little bit. Desigram. That is metric system. In general, whenever you see these prefixes, desi, centi, kilo, you're dealing with the metric system. No one ever talks about a kilopound. I guess you could, but no one really talks about it. Same thing. Millimeter. This is metric system. The gram is metric system. Meter is metric system. The foot is a US customary unit. We'll talk about whether it's a distance or any of that in a little bit. Kilogram. Once again, it is metric units. Blue for metric, in case you haven't gotten what I'm doing here. Blue for metric. Red for US customary units. I guess magenta. Centiliter. That is metric. Centimeter. Meters are metric. And notice, we have the prefix in both cases. Centi means one hundredth. Cup. That is US customary units. We have to do that in the magenta. Cup. US customary units. Meter. That is the metric system. Meter is the metric system. Pound. US customary units. It's getting a little tedious. Inch. Same thing. That's what we use in the US. Ounce. We use that in the US. And then the yard. We also use that in the US. Now, we've divided them up. All the magenta ones are used in the US. All of the blue ones are used really in the rest of the world and actually some places in the US as well. I think a lot of the world is frustrated that we're not all converted to this because the metric system is actually a little bit more logical. It's easy to just figure out what it's saying. We'll deal with that in more detail in the future. Now, the next thing we need to figure out is whether something is a measure of length, weight, slash mass. And they're not exactly the same thing. Mass is how much of a substance you have. Weight is the force with which gravity is pulling on that mass. And it would change depending on what planet you're on. But on Earth, they tend to be used interchangeably. So we'll use it roughly interchangeably here. And then you have volume, or how much space something takes up. So this is distance. This is moving in one dimension. Mass is how much stuff there is. Weight is how much the force that that stuff is pulled on on a planet by gravity, or I guess a star, anywhere. And volume is how much space does that stuff take up. Now, let's think about it. Liter is volume. This right here is volume. How much space do you take up? Gallon is also volume. That's in the US, in Europe, or in the metric system. It would be liter. Desigram. Gram is a unit of mass. So desigram just means 1 10th of a gram. Millimeter. Meter is a unit. Meter right here, that is a unit of distance, or of length. Millimeter, milli means 1,000th of a meter. Foot, that is also a unit of length. Kilogram, that just means 1,000 grams. Kilo means 1,000. Gram, we already said, is a unit of mass. Centiliter, that means 1 100th of a liter. Liter, we already figured out, is a unit of volume. Centimeter, we already figured out. Meter is a unit of length. Centimeter means 1 100th of a meter. So this is a unit of length. Cup, we've seen multiple times already. It is a unit of volume. How much space does something take up? Meter, that is length. We've seen it multiple times already. Pound, that is actually a unit of weight. That is a unit of weight. An inch is a unit of length. I think we're all familiar with it. An ounce is, and this you have to be careful here. If someone just says an ounce, that is 1 16th of a pound, it is a unit of weight. If it was written fluid ounce, then we'd be talking about 1 16th of a pint, and then it would be a unit of volume. But since it's just ounce, it's a unit of weight. 1 16th of a pound. And then finally, a yard is a unit of length. And we are done.\n",

      "Human beings have always realized that certain things are longer than other things. For example, this line segment looks longer than this line segment. But that's not so satisfying just to make that comparison. You want to be able to measure it. You want to be able to quantify how much longer the second one is than the first one. And how do we go about doing that? Well, we define a unit length. So if we make this our unit length, we say this is one unit, then we could say how many of those lengths are each of these lines? So this first line looks like it is. We can do one of those units, and then we can do it again. So it looks like this is two units, while this third one looks like we can get, let's see, that's one, two, three of the units. So this is three of the units. And right here, I'm just saying units. Sometimes we've made conventions to define a centimeter where the unit might look something like this, and it's going to look different depending on your screen. Or we might have an inch that looks something like this. Or we might have a foot that I won't be able to fit on this screen based on how big I've just drawn the inch or a meter. So there's different units that you could use to measure in terms of. But now let's think about more dimensions. This is literally a one-dimensional case. This is 1D. Why is it one dimension? Well, I can only measure length. But now let's go to a 2D case. Let's go to two dimensions where objects could have a length and a width or a width and a height. So let's imagine two figures here that look like this. So let's say this is one of them. This is one of them. And notice it has a width and it has a height. Or you could view it as a width and a length, depending on how you want to view it. So let's say this is one figure right over here. And let's say this is the other one right over here. Try to draw them reasonably well. Now once again, now we're in two dimensions. And we want to say, well, how much in two dimensions space is this taking up? Or how much area are each of these two taking up? Well, once again, we could just make a comparison. If you viewed them as carpets or rectangles, the second rectangle is taking up more of my screen than this first one. But I want to be able to measure it. So how would we measure it? Well, once again, we would define a unit square. Instead of just a unit length, we now have two dimensions. We have to define a unit square. And so we might make our unit square. And the unit square we will define as being a square where its width and its height are both equal to the unit length. So its width is one unit and its height is one unit. And so we will often call this one square unit. Oftentimes, you'll say this is one unit. And you put this 2 up here. This literally means one unit squared. And instead of writing unit, this could have been a centimeter. So this would be one square centimeter. But now we can use this to measure these areas. And we say, well, just as we said how many of this unit length could fit on these lines, we could say how many of these unit squares can fit in here? And so here, we might take one of our unit squares and say, OK, it fills up that much space. Well, we need more to cover all of it. There, we'll put another unit square there. We'll put another unit square right over there. We'll put another unit square right over there. Wow, four unit squares exactly cover this. So we would say that this has an area of four square units or four units squared. Now, what about this one right over here? Well, here, let's see, I could fit 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. So here, I could fit 9 units squared. Let's keep going. We live in a three-dimensional world. Why restrict ourselves to only one or two? So let's go to the 3D case. And once again, when people say 3D, they're talking about three dimensions. They're talking about the different directions that you can measure things in. Here, there's only length. Here, there's length and width or width and height. And here, there'll be width and height and depth. So once again, if you have, let's say, an object, and now we're in three dimensions. We're in the world we live in that looks like this. And then you have another object that looks like this. It looks like this second object takes up more space, more physical space, than this first object does. It looks like it has a larger volume. But how do we actually measure that? And remember, volume is just how much space something takes up in three dimensions. Area is how much space something takes up in two dimensions. Length is how much space something takes up in one dimension. But when we think about space, we're normally thinking about three dimensions. So how much space would you take up in the world that we live in? So just like we did before, we can define, instead of a unit length or a unit area, we can define a unit volume or a unit cube. So let's do that. Let's define our unit cube. And here, it's a cube, so all of its length, width, and height are going to be the same value. So my best attempt at drawing a cube. And they're all going to be one unit. So it's going to be one unit high, one unit deep, and one unit wide. And so to measure volume, we can say, well, how many of these unit cubes can fit into these different shapes? Well, this one right over here, and you won't be able to actually see all of them. I could essentially break it down into, so let me see how well I can do this, so that we can count them all. It's a little bit harder to see them all, because there's some cubes that are behind us. But if you think of it as two layers, so one layer would look like this. One layer is going to look like this. So imagine two things like this stacked on top of each other. So this one's going to have one, two, three, four cubes. Now, this is going to have two of these stacked on top of each other. So here, you have eight unit cubes, or you could have eight units cubed volume. What about here? Well, if we try to fit it all in, let me see how well I can draw this. It's going to look something like this. Obviously, this is kind of a rough drawing. And so if we were to try to take this apart, you'd essentially have three. You'd have a stack of three sections that would each look something like this. My best attempt at drawing it. Three sections that would look something like what I'm about to draw. So it would look like this. So if you took three of these and stacked them on top of each other, you would get this right over here. And each of these have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine cubes in it. Nine times three. You're going to have 27 cubic units in this one right over here. So hopefully that helps us think a little bit about how we measure things, especially how we measure things in different number of dimensions, especially in three dimensions when we call it volume.\n",

      "So, these are two pictures of the same figure. This is a front view of the object, and this is the back view of the object. And if a unit cube looks like this, what I want to do is I want to figure out the volume of this figure in terms of unit cubes, or in terms of cubic units. I encourage you to pause the video and think of it on your own before we try it together. All right, well, there's a bunch of ways that we could tackle this. All of them, kind of breaking this figure up in different ways. One way we could do it, we could break it up into this, I guess we could call it a rectangular prism. So, if you could see through there, it would be like this. So, this piece right over here. This piece right over here. And I'll redraw it here so you can visualize it. So, if I were to redraw it, it looks like this. It looks like this. And what are its dimensions? Well, it's four units wide. It's two units high. And then it's four units, we could say long, or four units deep. So, just like that. And so, what's the volume of this yellow part? Well, the volume is just you multiply these three dimensions. The length times the width times the height. So, the volume is going to be our length times our width times our height. Four times four is 16, times two is 32. But we're not done. That's just the volume of this yellow part. We still have to take into consideration the volume of this piece right over here that we haven't figured out yet. This piece right over there. And this one might just jump out at you. You could just count the unit cubes, but I'll redraw it here just to show you what's going on. All right, so it looks like this. It looks like this. And what are its dimensions? Well, it's two wide, two high, and we could say one deep or one long. And so, its volume is going to be equal to your length, or I could say, well, your length times your width times your height, which is equal to four. And you just see that. There's one, two, three, four unit cubes in this object. So the total volume is going to be 32 plus, 32 plus four is equal to 36. Now, of course, there's other ways to tackle it. You could just say, hey, let's figure out the volume of the blue layer and then just double it because that red layer has the same volume as the blue layer. And the blue layer, you could say, well, look, it's only one deep, so we just have to count the cubes up here and then we'll know how many unit cubes fit into it. So you literally could just count one, two, let me do it in a color you could actually see. You just have to go one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18. So you see there are 18 cubes in the blue layer and then there's another, there's going to be another 18 in the red layer, plus 18. That also gets you to 36 unit cubes or a volume of 36 cubic units.\n",

      "I have this figure here. You could call it a rectangular prism. And I want to measure its volume. And I'm defining my unit cube as being a 1 centimeter by 1 centimeter by 1 centimeter cube. It has 1 centimeter width, 1 centimeter depth, 1 centimeter height. And I will call this, this is equal to 1 cubic centimeters. So I want to measure this volume in terms of cubic centimeters. We've already seen that we can do that by saying, hey, how many of these cubic centimeters can fit into this figure without them overlapping in any way? So if we had this in our hands, we could kind of try to go around it and try to count it. But it's hard to see here, because there's some cubes that we can't see behind the ones that we are seeing. So I'm going to try different tactics at it. So first, let's just think about what we can observe. So we see that this one, if we measure its different dimensions, its width, it's 2 of the unit length wide. So it's 2 centimeters wide. It's 4 of our unit length. We're defining our unit length as a centimeter. It's 4 of our unit length high. So this dimension right over here is 4 centimeters. And it is 3 of our unit length deep. So this dimension right over here is 3 centimeters. So I want to explore if we can somehow use these numbers to figure out how many of these cubic centimeters would fit into this figure. And the first way I'm going to think about it is by looking at slices. So I'm going to take a slice. I'm going to take this slice right over here of our original figure. And let's think about how using these numbers, we can figure out how many unit cubes were in that slice. Well, this is 2 centimeters wide. And it is 4 centimeters high. And you might be saying, hey, Sal, I could just count these things. I could get 8 squares here. But what if there was a ton there? It would be a lot harder. And you might realize, well, I could just multiply the width times the height. That would give me the area of this surface right over here. And it's only 1 deep, so that also would give me the number of cubes. So let's do that. Let's find the area here. Well, that's going to be 2 centimeters times 4 centimeters. That gives us the area of this. And then if we want to find out the number of cubes, well, that's also going to be equivalent to the number of cubes. So we have 8 square centimeters is this area. And the number of cubes is 8. And if we want the number of cubes in the whole thing, we just have to multiply by the number of slices. And we see that we need 1, 2, 3 slices. This is 3 centimeters deep. So we're going to multiply that times 3. So we took the area of one surface. We took the area of this surface right over here. And then we multiply it by the depth. That essentially gives us the number of cubes, because the area of this surface gives us the number of cubes in a slice that is 1 cube deep. And then we would have to have 3 slices like that. So we would have to have, this is one slice. We would have to have another slice, another slice, and then another slice in order to construct the original figure. So 2 centimeters times 4 centimeters times 3 centimeters would give us our volume. Let's see if that works out. 2 times 4 is 8 times 3 is 24 centimeters cubed, or I could say cubic centimeters. So that's one way to measure the volume. Now, there's multiple surfaces here. I happened to pick this surface, but I could have picked another one. I could have picked this surface right over here and done the exact same thing. So let's pick this surface and do the exact same thing. This surface is 3 centimeters by 4 centimeters. Let me do that in that blue color. Color changing is always difficult. By 4 centimeters. So its area is going to be 12 square centimeters is the area of the surface. And 12 is also the number of cubes that we have in that slice. And so how many slices do we need in order to construct the original figure? Well, we need, it's 2 centimeters deep. This is only 1 centimeter deep, so we need 2 of them. We need 2 of them to construct the original figure. So we can essentially find the area of that first surface, which was 3 times 4, and then multiply that times the width, times how many of those slices you need. So times 2. And once again, this is going to be 3 times 4 is 12, times 2 is 24. I didn't write the units this first time. But that's going to give us the count of how many cubic centimeters we have, how many unit cubes we can fit. So once again, this is 24 cubic centimeters. And you can imagine, you could do the same thing, not with this surface, not with this surface, but with the top surface. The top surface is 3 centimeters deep and 2 centimeters wide, so you could view its area, or its area is going to be 3 centimeters times 2 centimeters. So that area is, let me do it in the same colors, 3 centimeters times 2 centimeters, which is 6 square centimeters. And that also tells you that there's going to be 6 cubes in this 1 cube deep slice. But how many of these slices do you need? Well, you have, this whole thing is 4 centimeters tall. And this thing is only 1 centimeter, so you're going to need 4 of them. So that's 2, 2, 3, 3, trying to draw it as neatly as I can, 3, and 4. You're going to need 4 of these. So to figure out the whole volume, you're going to have to take that and multiply that times 4 centimeters, which once again, 3 times 2 is 6 square centimeters, times 4 centimeters is 24 cubic centimeters. So it doesn't matter what order you multiply these in. You could view this, take the area of one side and multiply it times the depth, or you could take the surface area of another height and multiply it times the height or the width or the depth. And these are all the scenarios. But what it shows is it doesn't matter what order we multiply these three dimensions in. You could take the 2 times the 4 first and then multiply by the 3, or you could take the 3 times the 4 first and then multiply by the 2, or you could take the 2 times the 3 first and then multiply by the 4. When you're multiplying, it doesn't matter what order you're doing these in. And so if you have a rectangular prism like this and you know it's three dimensions, you know it's 2 centimeters wide, 3 centimeters deep, and 4 centimeters tall, you could say, hey, the volume of this thing, the number of unit cubes, the number of cubic centimeters it can fit is going to be 2 centimeters times 4 centimeters times 3 centimeters, which we've seen three times already is 24 cubic centimeters.\n",

      "We are asked, what is the volume of this box? And they tell us that each cube is a cubic foot. So just as a reminder, a volume is a measure of how much space does something take up. And it's usually measured in cubic units. And here, we're talking about cubic feet. And when they say that each cube is a cubic foot, they're saying that each of these little boxes, each of these cubes here, is exactly a 1 foot by 1 foot by 1 foot cube. We're in three dimensions right now. And we're talking about three dimensions. 3D, you literally need three dimensions. You need how tall you are, how wide you are, and how deep you are. And for a cubic foot, each of those dimensions is 1. So each of these are 1 cubic foot. The entire shape has 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 cubic feet in it. So the volume of this entire box is 6 cubic feet. And you see right here, the unit says feet. And it has a superscript here of 3. This is feet to the third power. You could use this as feet times feet times feet or cubic feet. So this is 6 cubic feet. Let's do a few more of these. What is the volume of this shape? So this one is quite interesting right over here. Let's see if we can count these. So you have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 unit boxes. Or I guess these are cubic inches for this example. So we have 8 cubic inches. This is a lot of fun, especially when we get to rotate it. So here, each cube is a cubic foot again. So we have 1, 2, 3 cubic feet. Let's do one more of these. I like the ones that have these kind of crazy shapes that we have to rotate to be able to see all the boxes. So each of these is a cubic meter, which means that in each dimension, each of these boxes is a 1 by 1 by 1 meter. But how many boxes are there? Let's see, we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 boxes. So the total volume here is 6 cubic meters.\n",

      "What is the volume of this box? Drag on the box to rotate it. So this is pretty neat. We can actually sit and rotate this box. But we've already seen, and here it looks like everything's being measured in meters. So we want to measure our volume in terms of cubic meters. That's going to be our unit cube here. So when we want to think about how many cubic meters could fit in this box, we've already seen examples that you really just have to multiply the three different dimensions of this box. So if you wanted the number of cubic meters that could fit in here, it's going to be 6 meters times 8 meters times 7 meters, which is going to give you something in cubic meters. So let's think about what that is. 6 times 8 is 48. Let me see if I can do this in my head. 48 times 7, that's 40 times 7, which is going to be 280, plus 8 times 7, which is 56. 280 plus 56 is going to be 336. Let's check our answer. Let's do one more of these. So what's the volume of this box? Well, once again, we have its height at 6 feet. Now everything's being measured in feet. We have its width being 4 feet. So we can multiply the height times the width of 4 feet. And then we can multiply that times its depth of 2 feet. So times its depth of 2 feet. So 6 times 4 is 24, times 2 is 48 feet. And I should say cubic feet. We're saying how many cubic feet can fit in here. When we multiply the various dimensions measured in feet, we're essentially saying we're counting almost how many of those cubic feet can fit into this box.\n",

      "Let's see if we can figure out the volume of this figure over here. And they've given us some of the dimensions. We see this side over here is two centimeters, this is seven centimeters, this is 12 centimeters, this is five centimeters, this is three centimeters. And so like always, pause this video and see if you can figure it out. Well, there's a bunch of ways to do this, but the way I'd like to do it is just to break it up into two rectangular prisms. So what I'm gonna do is, in fact, most of the reasonable ways to do this would be to break it up into two rectangular prisms. And the ones that jump out at me is one prism like this that is three centimeters wide, five centimeters high, and then it is seven centimeters long, or seven centimeters deep. So this one right over here. And if this part right over here was transparent, you would see it look just like this. You would see it look just like this. And so this one, once again, it is three centimeters wide, three centimeters wide, and centimeters long, seven centimeters long. So this distance right over here is going to be the same as this distance right over here. So seven centimeters long. So the width times the length times the height, it's five centimeters, gets us to, let's see, three times seven is 21, times five is equal to, 20 times five is 100, one times five is five, so it's going to be 105. And we could say 105 cubic centimeters, because you have centimeters times centimeters times centimeters. So this blue part right over here, this blue rectangular prism, has a volume of 105 cubic centimeters. So now we can separately figure out the volume of what I'm now highlighting in this magenta color. What I'm highlighting in this magenta color. If this was transparent, you would see this part back over here, and right over here. So what are its dimensions? Well, we know its height is two centimeters. We know that this dimension right over here, I guess we could say it's depth, we could call it that, is seven centimeters. But what is this right over here? If we want to consider this, maybe it's length, or maybe it's width, depending on what we want to call it. Well, let's see. This whole thing is 12 centimeters. From here to here is 12 centimeters. And we know that from here to here is three centimeters. So this piece right over here, this piece over here must be nine centimeters. So that must be nine centimeters, is this distance right over here. So the volume of this magenta part is going to be nine centimeters times seven centimeters times the height, times two centimeters, which is going to get us, well, let's see, nine times seven is 63. 63 times two is equal to, 60 times two is 120. Three times two is six. So it's 126 cubic centimeters. So the total volume of the entire thing is going to be the volume of the magenta stuff, which is 126 cubic centimeters, plus the volume of the blue stuff, plus 105 cubic centimeters. And that's going to give us, for the entire figure, six plus five is 11. So one plus two is three, or it's really one ten plus two ten is three tens. And then 100 plus 100 is 200. So we get 231, 231 cubic centimeters is the volume of the entire thing. Fascinating.\n",

      "A water tank is 12 feet high, 5 feet long, and 9 feet wide. A solid metal box, which is 7 feet high, 4 feet long, and 8 feet wide, is sitting at the bottom of the tank. The tank is filled with water. What is the volume of the water in the tank? So let's think about this. We have a water tank. It's 12 feet high. I'll try to draw this as good as I can. So it's 12 feet high. It's 5 feet long. So this looks like that's about 5 feet. And it's 9 feet wide. So this is my best rendition of what the tank looks like. So the tank might look something like this. That is my water tank. Let me draw the whole thing. So there's my water tank. And I'm going to make it transparent so that we can see what's going on inside of the tank. So here we go. There's like a helicopter outside or something. I don't know if you all hear that. But let's see. So there is my water tank. 12 feet high, 5 feet long, and 9 foot wide. And then they say there's a solid metal box, which is 7 feet high, 4 feet long, and 8 feet wide, sitting at the bottom. So let's see if I can draw that. So let's say it's 4 feet long, 7 feet high. So let's see, 4 feet might look something like this. It's 7 feet high, which might look something like that. 7 feet high. Obviously, I'm not drawing it perfectly to scale. 7 feet high and 8 feet wide. So it might look something like this as it's sitting in this tank. So this is that metal box. And they say it's a solid metal box. It's not like any water can fit in here. So let me make it as a solid metal box. So this is a solid metal box. And then I'm going to fill the whole thing with water. I'm going to pour water into this thing. And the water is going to start filling up. And it's going to fill up all the volume of the tank, except where the metal box is. It's not going to be able to fill in that volume, because the metal box is solid. So it's going to fill up. We're going to slowly fill this thing up around the metal box. So what's the volume that it's going to fill up? Well, it's going to fill up the volume of the tank minus the volume of the metal box. It couldn't fill in the metal box volume. So let's figure out what that is. The volume of the tank is going to be 9 foot by 5 foot times 12 feet. That's the volume of the tank. Tank volume. And from that, we want to subtract the metal box volume. So minus 4 foot by 8 feet by 7 feet. This is 4 feet wide. It is 7 feet high. It's 4 feet long. And it's 8 feet wide. So this right over here is the volume. I guess we could call it the metal box volume. And so what's in between, or when you take the tank volume, subtract out the box volume, that's how much the water can actually fill in. So I only do the water partially filled. But once it's already filled in, the water's going to go all the way to the top here. And it will fill in everything except for where that blue box is. So let's figure out what this value is. So 5 times 12 is 60. 60 times 9 is 540. And then in blue here, let's see. 4 times 8 is 32. 32 times 7 is 210 plus 14, which is 224. So that's minus 224. Did I do that right? I don't want to make a careless mistake. So 32 times 7. 2 times 7 is 14. 3, which is really a 30 here. 30 times 7 is 210 plus another 10 is 220. So 224. So this is going to be equal to, let's see, 500 minus 200 is 300. 340 minus 24 is 16. And our units are in cubic feet. So the volume of the water in a tank, 316 cubic feet.\n",

      "Miranda's maid service charges $280 to clean 8 offices. What is the company's price for cleaning a single office? So they charge $280 to clean 8 offices. So it's $280 for every 8 offices. And then we can simplify this. We can see, well, are both of them divisible by a common factor? And this one looks like it is divisible by 8. 200 is divisible by 8. And then 80 is divisible by 8 as well. So let's divide both the numerator and the denominator by 8. And if we do that, 8 goes into 280. 8 goes into 28 3 times. 3 times 8 is 24. Subtract. You have 4 left over. 8 minus 4 is 4. Bring down this 0. 8 goes into 40 exactly 5 times. 5 times 8 is 40. And you have no remainder. So when you divide 280 by 8, you get 35. And if you divide 8 by 8, you get 1. So this rate simplifies to, this price per office, I guess we could call it, simplifies to $35 for every 1 office, which we could also write as 35 over 1 dollars per office, which is the exact same thing as $35 per office. And we're done. That is the company's price for cleaning a single office, $35.\n",

      "In a language class, the girl to boy ratio is 5 to 8. So for every 5 girls, we have 8 boys. If there are a total of 65 students, how many girls are there? So this is interesting. They give us the ratio of girls to boys, but then they want us to think about how many girls there are, given that there are 65 total students. So what we really want to think about is not just the ratio of girls to boys. We want to think about the ratio of girls to total students. So how can we figure out what this ratio is going to be? Well, the girl to boy ratio gives us a good clue. The ratio for if there's 5 girls for every 8 boys, how many total students are there going to be for every 5 girls? Well, for every 5 girls, you're going to have 5 girls and 8 boys. You're going to have 13 total students. So I just added the 5 and the 8 right over here. The ratio of girls to total students is 5 to 13. One way of thinking about it is if you were to evenly divide the students into groups of 13, every group of 13 students would have 5 girls. Now, I think we're ready to figure out how many total girls there are, because they tell us that there are 65 students. There are 65 students. So we don't just have one group of 13. We have 65 students. And how many groups of 13 is 65? Well, to go from 13 to 65, you have to multiply by 5. 5 times 10 is 50. 5 times 3 is 15. Right, 13 times 5 is 65. So essentially, one way you could do it is you have 5 groups of 13. So if you have 5 groups of 13, each of those are going to have 5 girls. Multiply by 5, you're going to have 25 girls. So for every 65 students, you're going to have 25 girls, given the information that has been given.\n",
