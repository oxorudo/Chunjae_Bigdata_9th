Physically, sleep is important for healing and repair, as well as boosting the immune system. A lack of sleep can lead to various health issues such as increased stress, weakened immunity, and long-term problems like heart disease. Itâ€™s essential to establish good sleep habits, such as sticking to a regular bedtime, limiting screen time before bed, and creating a calm sleep environment.'\n",
